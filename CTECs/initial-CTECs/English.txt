Comments
This course is pretty easy going while helping develop writing skills. MUST DO READINGS TO DO WELL. The professor does a good job in helping communicate ideas. Very helpful during individual conferences. Overall, a good class.
Sara was very engaging, personable, and always prepared with material for each class section. She made the course interesting by varying the content but tying it all to common, overarching themes. The feedback she provides is very helpful, and she's always willing to answer questions or provide further reading if you reach out as she is very knowledgeable on the subject.

Comments
The reading assignments were fair and most of the time were somewhat entertaining. Class time was engaging when we discussed the reading.
It is a great class for improving your writing skills as well as reading skills.
I took this course for pretty much no reason at all. I signed up for a sociology class in the same time slot initially, ended up very disenchanted with that class and the instruction, so I dropped it and looked for something that fit in the same time slot, and found this class. So, to be frank, I wasn’t really expecting anything out of it. However, it ended up being a surprisingly good course for me. I’d consider myself a reasonably strong/good writer, generally speaking, but even so this course taught me multiple ways that I could refine and improve my writing, in a variety of contexts. It focuses on multiple styles of writing (research�mia, criticism/review, opinion, etc.) and the instructor is sure to offer you personalized critique and advice for your writing in each style. 


Overall, I was very pleased with the course. The readings aren’t too hard, and yes there are three papers, but they’re very well laid out with clear deadlines and goals, so they’re not all that hard. My vote would be if you’re looking to improve your writing, regardless of context, give this class a try.
I thought this class was helpful if you want to improve your essay writing skills, organization techniques and strategies. I found it hard to catch up with all the reading but when I did, they were very helpful.
Great class, learned a lot to help improve my writing, just go to class and do most of the readings (skimming them is fine)

Comments
This course is a lot of reading but the plays Dr. Phillips picks are enjoyable. Two papers, a midterm and a final. The exams are very fair and she offers extra credit. She expects a lot out of the essays but definitely pushes you to improve your writing.
The TAs and Professor Philips were amazing. AMAZING.
As a senior who never had an interest in Shakespeare, this was the best course I've taken in college. The professor is amazing and builds a personal relationship with every student and brings out all the intricacies of Shakespeare's plays.
This is an amazing course and Professor Phillips is the BEST! We cover a ton of material (it is definitely a lot of reading) but it was super worth it because of how much I learned. Also a good blend of text, films, and productions so you get a really well-rounded exposure to Shakespeare. Lectures were always incredibly engaging and made me think about the plays differently. Professor Phillips really cares about her students, too, which made the experience really enjoyable. Overall a great class, would highly recommend!
I really enjoyed taking this course and reading the course texts. I would basically recommend this class to anyone. On top of all of that the instruction from both the professor and the TAs was really good.
Great for learning how to read a little deeper into Shakespeare, not super difficult, good for distro
A great course to take with a brilliant professor. Prof. Phillips is incredibly adept instructor and is amazingly energetic, bringing up various elements of plays while also using other materials such as movies and contemporary references to guide the course along.
The class is a fair amount of work, as you have 2 papers, a mid-term exam, and final exam, as well as in-class performances and you have to be regular with the reading. The extra-credit work for the pop-culture challenge also adds a time- commitment element to the class, so it adds up.
GREAT COURSE! I love shakespeare, and prof Phillips is a fantastic lecturer. She presents the material in an intteresting, engaging way, and the papers/midterm aren't very tough.
This course was AMAZING. Prof. Phillips was amazing and I can't imagine taking this course without her. Her lectures were always interesting but it was important that you did the reading. Honestly this class is a lot of work and if you don't enjoy the subject or the teaching style of Prof. Phillips, then this class isn't for you. But if you do take it, know that she's amazing and the TAs are there to help you out! There are 2 papers, a midterm and a final.
I had very little interest in taking this course, and ended up taking it because of a scheduling conflict. That said, I am so glad that I ended up in this class because I have learned so much and had a lot of fun. Professor Phillips is a master of making a 100+ person lecture feel like a discussion, and the TAs are brilliant. As someone who only read Shakespeare in high school, I wasn't very enthusiastic about reading Shakespeare, but Professor Phillips changed my whole outlook on the matter. This is a great class for English majors, theatre majors, or anyone who wants to become a better close reader.
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN EASY DISTRO. I took this class having flown through AP and honors English classes in high school with a strong Shakespeare background. This class is by no means an easy A whatsoever or even remotely close. This class is dominated by theatre and journalism majors who really have a burning passion for Shakespeare and the professor and TA pick favorites very quickly. The TA constantly had nonsensical comments on papers (i.e. this paper is too thesis driven) then assigned subpar grades with little explanation. Papers are also fairly long (4-6 pages, 2 total). Pop quizzes are given to ensure attendance but often include extremely difficult and ambiguous questions. Exams include identifying fairly ambiguous quotes and explaining their relevance. If you explain a theme different than the theme intended, you are penalized severely. Professor Phillips is extremely passionate about the subject, but my TA was pretentious and would offer little to no help in office hours. This was the worst and most difficult class I took this quarter, and I also took intensive abstract linear algebra. TERRIBLE CLASS DO NOT TAKE.
This was a great course for developing critical thinking and analyzing text. I learned a lot and Professor Phillips was great. However it was a lot of reading, about a play a week so it will take a lot of time, especially if you want to read the plays closely.
This course is good for people who are very interested in English, however I would not recommend it as a distro because there is a lot of reading and it was at times difficult to keep up with. It was extremely helpful to learn about close reading and analyzing text, especially considering our essays were normally focused on a very small part of a particular play.
I enjoyed the plays we read, the movies we watched, and Professor Phillip's analysis on the plays. The discussions we had in lecture were interesting, but sometimes relied too much on student participation when I wish I got to hear more from Professor Phillips.
This course was a pretty good one. It was interesting and Professor Phillips is very engaging and exciting. It was just A LOT to handle, as we had to read 7 of Shakespeare's plays over the whole quarter--which is a lot, especially in the tiny-font Norton book. The plays were fun to read, though, and it was interesting to hear others' perspectives. I just think it might be better if we could read even one less play, to have more time to understand it and go a lot more in-depth.
This was a truly unbelievable class. Professor Phillips is one of the most amazing lecturers I have ever had, and I could not recommend this class more highly. However, this is certainly not an easy and light work 200 level English class, so be prepared to work hard! If you like Shakespeare at all, you will LOVE this class.
Professor Phillips is an absolutely incredible professor and this class was phenomenal. Very few professors make the effort to get to know their students like she does, and the class, despite being tremendously quickly paced, was an absolutely amazing time and helped me learn a ton about Shakespeare and his works. I feel like I know significantly more coming out of this class than I did going in, and I'm very tremendously happy that I took it and would recommend it to any student who is even remotely interested in Shakespeare. Again, this class moves tremendously quickly, and I would not take it with an already busy schedule, but I took it as a distribution requirement and it was by far my favorite course of the quarter.
This class was a lot of work (obviously because we basically read a play a week) but in ways that I wasn't expecting too. There's a graded scene performance and the midterm˿inal are ridiculous in the amount of writing they expect you to do in an hour and a half (and then they're graded harshly with no explanation as to what you did wrong). It's all way too much for a 200-level distro, and even though I liked the professor and my TA, it wasn't worth it. Don't take it unless you're a theater major who writes well and talks all the time; these people were like half the class and completely dominated lecture and discussion, so I assume they're doing well in the class.
It was really fun. We got to act out scenes from different plays, and form arguments from the text. It was a great intellectually stimulating class.
Very engaging and interesting way of teaching Shakespeare
This class was great but not easy. It is certainly not an easy A, there are 2 essays, a midterm, and a final, and each of them are graded very harshly - maybe too harshly for an introductory course. That being said, Professor Phillips is a great teacher and really makes Shakespeare very interesting to discuss. She is adept at teaching a large group of student yet making it feel like a smaller discussion-based class. Nina was a great TA and super helpful - I would take this class if you are at all interested in Shakespeare or english classes.
This is a fantastic course. Professor Phillips is an incredibly engaging, incisive, funny lecturer who gets right to the heart of each of the plays. She has very high standards and I felt pushed to put out my best work all quarter, but the classroom had a very inspiring, non-oppressive feel to it. I felt like I really grew as a reader of Shakespeare and an analytical writer this quarter. Also, I had already read four of the seven plays in high school, but Phillips examines them much more rigorously than my high school teachers ever did, so I was by no means bored. I highly, highly recommend!
It was a lot of work, but forcing yourself to read all the plays and deeply analyze what is being said is a very important skill and I definitely improved in that regard.
Heavy reading. Read one play a week, for the most part. Two papers and a midterm and final. There were about three pop quizzes in lecture. Overall, highly recommend the course. Was my most interesting and engaging course of the quarter. Dont think there could be a professor more thoughtful, detailed, and caring than Professor Phillips that could teach this course. Definitely not an easy course, but completely worth the time and effort.
I would recommend this course to anyone. Professor Phillips in such an intelligent, informed professor who makes lectures incredibly engaging. Because we read and discussed so much Shakespeare in the quarter, I quickly became so much more comfortable with the material so each consecutive play became easier to understand and analyze. This class is a lot of reading, however. We had to read a full Shakepeare play almost every week so even though I absolutely loved the class, you have to be prepared for that much Shakespeare reading every week.
This course was excellent! Professor Phillips is a passionate and inspired teacher, and there was always something new and exciting to talk about in lecture. The TAs were fantastic, and I really got a lot out of discussion sections.
As someone who loathes Shakespeare, I found myself pleasantly surprised at this course. I was dreading it, especially after getting a C in high school Shakespeare, but this course totally changed how I look at Shakespeare. Readings can be tedious and the midterm˾xam is difficult, but you can easily prepare for it by taking good notes during lecture and re-reading the plays before exams.
Iɽ say it's a good freshman "intro to college class," but I didn't find it very valuable as an upperclassman. The exams are about regurgitating the themes that the professor presents in class rather than presenting your own analyses, and there is a lot of memorization required that I do not find valuable. Was excited to take this course because I love Shakespeare, but I was left disillusioned.
The reading is manageable but the course content is very difficult and the workload is high. The pop quizzes aren't too bad, but the essays are fairly involved (6ish pages of close analysis), and there is a section performance that is a very very difficult assignment if you're not used to memorizing and performing plays (I had to memorize about 50 lines). The midterm exam is difficult but manageable if you just read the plays, and they can't be easily bypassed by reading summaries. In addition to the pop quizzes, midterm, and first essay, there is both a final essay and a final exam, which really feels like way too much work for a distro. A lot of students in the class were theater kids and really seemed to enjoy it, but it's not that way if you have very little interest in Shakespeare. I had trouble keeping up with the lectures, but that's really mostly because I was uninterested in the subject. But I think Suzy is a good lecturer, and she has enthusiasm for the subject, so I can see why students who like the subject would enjoy the lectures. To recap, this class has three pop quizzes, two essays, two exams, and a performance. None of these assignments is easy. I would not recommend this class unless you have a strong interest in theater or Shakespeare, and I would not recommend it to people in STEM who are doing this for the distro. There are much easier distros out there. One final thing: the class is very geared toward freshmen, and the vast majority of students are freshmen.
This course is extremely well taught. Both the professor and the TAs are unbelievably passionate and knowledgeable. Every class is a combination of lecture, discussion, close reading, performances, film viewings, trivia and more, which always keeps it exciting. Expectations are high, but the material and its presentation are exemplary.
Definitely more time consuming than some other English classes. Professor Phillips is a great professor though and if you keep up with the reading (unlike me) you'll be fine
I absolutely loved this class, it was a lot of work, but none of it was busywork, Phillips and the TAs really want to make sure you learn as much as you can and are very passionate about the topics.
Kinda annoying course, although professor genuinely cares.
Professor Phillips is incredibly knowledgeable and so engaging. She is possibly one of the best professors I've had here so far. Shakespeare really scared me at the beginning of this quarter and her class made the material feel so much more accessible and exciting to discuss. She truly teaches the class in a way that shows how much she cares about students learning and your grade will truly affect the work you've put in. It's by no means easy, but if you show up to lecture and read the plays, you will gain so much from this course and feel challenged as well as supported!!
Professor Phillips is the nicest human being. Taking a class with her is a must.
We covered plays in different mediums, through live performance, reading, and media, which I think is important for grasping how the Bard's work can be interpreted. Overall the course is great, covering so much in so short a time that it's impossible to feel like you haven't learned anything.
The course was interesting, but the requirements of watching a movie and reading a play every week take more time than expected.
This course is really interesting, but requires a lot of out of class time because of all the reading. You read one play per week, and because of the nature of the exams, you really have to read the real plays.
Not an intro course. Extensive reading every single week and pop quizzes. TA also was extremely unhelpful. Exams were a poor measure of what we learned
This is a really worthwhile class. Phillips has a passion for Shakespeare, and it comes through in her fascinating and thought-provoking lectures. Grading isn't incredibly easy, but Phillips and her TAs clearly want students to succeed. The course isn't a huge time investment, and it's fairly easy to do well if one reads the plays by the time one is supposed to. Definitely a great class to take for prospective majors or otherwise.
It was an interesting class to fill a distro without being burdensome
Professor Phillips is one of the most brilliant teachers I have ever encountered. The way she engages with her students on not only an intellectual but a personal level is incredible. She knew every one of the 100ish students' names by the end of the first week. She took the passion I already harbored for Shakespeare and his works and amplified it by introducing whole new ways of thinking about texts I may already have read. I cannot stress enough that everyone even remotely interested in Shakespeare should undoubtedly and immediately try to fit it into their schedule next fall. One of a kind.
The class was fine. Although, if I could go back, I would not take it. I did not like the lecturing style of Prof. Phillips. It constantly felt as if we were in a high school lecture. It was a huge lecture, yet most of class was spent as if it were a discussion. It became hard to follow, and tiresome.
Everything Susie Phillips says is enlightening.
I loved this class. I improved my argumentative writing and close reading skills. In addition, I got to learn a lot about Shakespeare's works in a very engaging setting! You get the grades you deserve in this class. You get out of this class what you put into it. Solid class overall.
I thought the course was overall interesting and enjoyable. You have to read a lot of plays, but the pacing of the course made it bearable, and there were opportunities to catch up. Overall the papers were interesting and the tests fair.
It is jam packed with theatre majors, so the curve is not that good. As a comms major, it was sometimes overwhelming because the theatre kids always try to be above and beyond during lecture, so be prepared for that. You only write 2 major papers, which is not bad at all as long as you do the readings. The mid terms and finals are hard in that you really have to close read each of the texts and actually watch the movies on your own time.
As a junior, it can be easy to feel jaded in big lectures, but this was honestly one of my favorite courses I have taken at NU. I really have a new appreciation for Shakespeare's plays, and Phillips is so so smart, caring and an overall awesome professor! Take this class!
This course pushed my analysis and required that I become a more focused writer. Much of the readings were readings of Shakespeare's Plays with little extraneous material, which made the outside reading requirement relatively low. Both Professor Phillips and my TA were extremely helpful and presented interesting interpretations of the plays.
I loved the plays and enjoyed listening to her analysis, but the exams and papers were incredibly difficult and we were not prepared for them. The midterms had no review material or study guides, yet had incredibly specific rubrics and were largely based on memorization or details not emphasized in class.
Professor Philips is SO FANTASTIC! This was by far the best class I took this quarter, and probably one of the best I'll ever take. Her lectures encouraged me to think about the plays and to participate in class (she remembered everyone's names after week 2), and hugely added to my reading and interpretation of the plays. When you learn Shakespeare, you learn about all of literature, and as the weeks went by, I really came to a much deeper understanding of the themes and writing of his plays. Professor Phillips is incredibly charismatic, and manages to inspire students by making the themes of 400 year old plays freshly original and relevant to our time. This is definitely a hard class, with tons of reading and writing (especially in exams), but I was very motivated by the lectures to improve over the course. Don't take this if you're swamped with all of your other classes (do it right) of if you're not interested in Shakespeare and the process of reading and analyzing it, but this is an absolutely amazing lecture and is very rewarding. SO GOOD!
At the beginning of the course, I was definitely bogged down by the reading. I was trying to understand every little thing about every play, which slowed me down significantly. But, once I got a feel for what the professor was looking for, I began to enjoy the course a lot more. Professor Phillips's theses in class caught me as very surprising and were fun to follow along or argue against. And although I felt a bit too nervous to speak up in lecture, discussion sections eased that tension quite a bit. My least favorite part was probably the movies; I fell asleep most of the time and my interest in Shakespeare waned because of them.
This class helped develop my love and passion for reading, writing about, and above all, studying Shakespeare.
This course was incredibly well-constructed and informative. Professor Phillips challenged us intellectually, while making sure that her lessons were clear and understandable. It is a large class, but she made the class environment feel small/intimate as she constantly was encouraging students to participate/speak up and contribute to her lectures. She also remembers everyone's names, which just goes to show her amazing attention to detail, and the genuine care she has for her students. She is incredibly fair regarding the difficulty of tests/homework, and grading. Incredibly fair.
I had a great time. Even though it was an early class it was fun to be in as Professor Phillips lectures were always engaging. She lead the class in examining the text in new ways so that even if you had read them before, you saw a new perspective. I wish there were more graded opportunities because there were only two papers to demonstrate your growth. The reading seems like a lot at first but as the course continues you tend to get faster, and your reading more close just based on the example set by the lectures. The mid term and exam were both fair assessments of course knowledge.
The professor was fantastic! Her takes on Shakespeare and her ability to deliver it clearly and entertainingly in lecture made this class amazing. The TAs were also particularly good (a/o to Harris) and helped a lot.
This is the BEST class at Northwestern, Susan Phillips is a magical woman and truly changed/grew me as a learner and shakespeare-lover. This class completely cracked open Shakespeare and made it accessible to me, which I really appreciated especially as a theater major. The discussions and lectures were crazy compelling and interesting. By about the third class Susan Phillips knew every students name in the lecture... which was about 100 kids. It was remarkable to feel how invested she was in the class and in the students and in the material. It was fun, and interesting, and fair. (Tests were hard but if you showed up and read the material they were very fair). Good stuff!
I absolutely loved this course, and have never learned more about Shakespeare or his work than I did this quarter. The professor is phenomenal, and her TA's were all top-notch. For some, reading Shakespeare might be a chore, but in this class you learn to read it much like its own language and it is so much fun. Highly recommended.
This class and its CTECs LIE. No one told me before taking this class how much I would regret taking it in the first place. If you are not a theater major avoid at all costs. She speaks to the class like they are freshmen in high school, and grades like they're English majors. You have to study 7 plays and get tested on random passages with no context. You write an in-class essay for the final after you already turned in a final paper. There were several classes where I left frustrated knowing I didn't have to be there at all. Take if you love raising your hand and talking for 5 minutes about Othello in front of a 150 person lecture!

Comments
This course is incredible. Everyone should take it. Professor Phillips is brilliant and brings the course material to life.
This is very much a class geared towards freshmen, so it was somewhat awkward taking this class as a senior for a distribution. Professor Phillips is a good lecturer, and the course looked at several works from new angles that I had not anticipated. The pacing of the course is fairly quick, and there are (unfortunately) pop quizzes, so it's important to stay on top of the readings. That said, the time requirements are not too bad, so it's a good course for a distribution requirement.
This is definitely not an easy class and I am not expecting excellent grades but I still think taking this class was a right thing to do! Professor Phillips is truly the best professor ever both academic-wise and personality-wise!
I loved this class; Professor Phillips is wonderful and each lecture was more interesting than the last. There is quite a bit of reading and the exams are challenging, as they involve a great deal of writing within a small timeframe.
The professor is incredibly engaging and the course is great all around. Also great TAs
I'm a math major and I enjoyed this course a lot. It was a distro for me, and I've had some Shakespeare experience, but that doesn't mean it was extremely easy. I was still challenged at times but it was worth it. Prof Philips is a great, great teacher; she gave so much info about the plays that helped for quizzes and papers and the midterm. She also kept it lively, not just boring lecture. There were a few reading quizzes (pretty simple), a midterm which was short answers, two papers not too long, and a final which was short answer and an essay question. Overall, the material was doable. I found sections to be good too. If you have any interest, consider taking it with Philips for sure!
This is an amazing course. Intro to Shakes will make you a better reader, writer, and person, and the professor, Susie Phillips, is amazing.
I loved this class! Prof. Susie Phillips is a dream. She preps like a whole essay worth of material for each class and hits that perfect balance between lecture and discussion (especially for a class this big)! It is a totally manageable amount of work and the number of plays we had to read was honestly way better than I thought it would be. There were a crazy amount of theater kids but I totally still knew people in the class! Def take this class
It's difficult, especially with the reading and trying to keep one play straight from the other because some of the questions are applicable with a lot of plays which makes her quizzes and exams challenging. But it's a good challenge and pushed me to study and develop better habits as a student. DON'T TAKE IT if you don't pay attention to detail or like diving deep into texts and their historical significance. This is not the course for you
Prof. Phillips is probably the best professor I had at Northwestern. She for sure made me a better writer, thinker, and she takes time to get to know all her students, even in a large class. Lots of work for the class, as there are papers, tests, and section, but it is worth it. Also, Matt Beeber is an amazing TA.
The pace was a bit rough, and I was never 100% certain what acts and scenes she wanted us to read by what class--it averaged out to a play a week. Stay on top of the reading because there is a lot! She does give pop quizzes, but they're relatively straight forward (though sometimes if you weren't sure if you were supposed to read the whole play or just the first 3 acts, you could lose points on a quiz when it tested over the whole thing). A lot of information is thrown at you, but it is super interesting. The professor is engaging and understanding-very easy to talk to. There's not much time for the midterm or final, so write fast. Overall a great class that really digs into the text and makes you think.
This class was awesome! There was a lot of reading. 2 exams and 2 papers mainly. If you are bad at keeping up on reading this may not be the best.
Professor Phillips is incredibly passionate. It can be difficult to keep up at times, but the challenge pays off.
Prof. Phillips is one of the greatest people I have ever met. Even if you don't like Shakespeare, take this class to get to know her and learn about life.
Take this class with Susie Phillips! She is a fantastic professor and very knowledgeable about everything. This class will challenge you to closely analyze Shakespeare's texts, you will be pushed in that aspect, but a very fun and helpful English distro. ALSO TA Matt Beeber is the best, take any class that he is TAing.
This class is a lot of reading, but it's never boring. Susie Phillips is WONDERFUL. Her lectures were so engaging, and she made an effort to connect with every student, despite the large class size. Take this class!
Class was always super interesting. Professor Philips is amazing and brought so much energy to class every morning. You can tell she really cares about her students and class content. She also brings candy to class all the time.
Take this class even if you have the slightest interest in Shakespeare! Professor Phillips is genuinely a captivating and interesting lecturer and all the TA's are wonderful. It is fast paced though, so make sure to keep up with the play readings. 10⼐ recommend, as this is the best class I've taken at Northwestern so far. I met close friends due to how interactive the class is, and the discussion sections were stimulating but also really enjoyable. Prof. Phillips also knew all our names by the 3rd class!
I really liked the teacher's ability to address the student's thoughts but also to challenge us to point to the text and to think of the why.
Professor Phillips is AMAZING. She might be the best professor I've had at Northwestern so far. The lectures are all extremely engaging, the readings are obviously interesting given that they're all Shakespeare plays and the TAs were all great. I would 100% recommend this course to anyone.
I love this course. It is certainly not easy, but Professor Phillips made me look forward to coming to class everyday which is the most important part of teaching.
Take this course for SUZIE. She is unbelievable and I've learned so much from her.
Really, really interesting class. Professor Phillips is engaging, caring, and easily the smartest woman I've ever met. She makes an effort, even though it's a large class, to get to know a majority of her students. I would take any class she taught. 11⼐ recommend.
As a theater minor, I wanted to learn more about literature and how it relates to performance, which this course actually does a lot of, but not too much (so if you are not into performing, that doesn't matter, it's still a great course). I learned more about how to analyze texts, and even more about what Shakespeare was trying to say with his writing, and even things that he may have no intended, but now in modern times we recognize and interpret. It gave me a whole new perspective on Shakespeare's work.
My main reason for taking this class was that I wanted to read more Shakespeare, and I definitely did that! We read 7 plays throughout the year that I really enjoyed and and had really interesting classroom discussions about all of them. However, I thought the midterm and final were WAY to long, for even though I knew all of the information, I still couldn't finish in time. Still a good class to take!
This course was a lot of work, but was also an enjoyable class. Lots of different components - papers, tests, performances, discussion, readings - but if you went to class and read the plays you could do fine. Great professor and TAs.
Great class, definitely more work than your average 200 distro, but definitely worth it. Phillips is a very engaging lecturer, and you definitely come out of this class with more appreciation for the material.
One of the most important aspects of this class that I noticed is how important it is to Professor Phillips that everyone does well on papers and the mid-term. She truly does care about each and every one of her students and reaches out to anyone who is in need of help. The lecture sometimes was a little tedious to get through since you just go through quotes about the play you are reading, but the arguments that are made by Professor Phillips in these lectures do elucidate a key characteristic of the play. The papers are oddly enjoyable. The quizzes suck, but they are not that important in the final grade so that makes up for it. The discussion sections were awesome. My TA was fun and really got us to think about the play in a different way than i had ever thought about Shakespearean plays. Cameron helped us out with anything that we needed and he read my thesis on my final paper to see if i had a strong argument, which really helped me a lot. In short, this class was spectacular because of the importance that the professor and Teacher's Assistant gives to every student, even though the material was not that exciting.
Awesome class. Professor Phillips is DOPE and so is Delali. It's a LOT of reading, but it's worth it in my opinion.
Professor Phillips is awesome. She's a fantastic lecturer and if you're interested in English, you need to take a class with her before you leave. The readings can be long but it isn't too brutal, and it's easy to play to catch up if you have to. Definitely take this class if you want a cool English elective.
This course is fantastic if you want a nice introduction to Shakespeare with a fantastic teacher and great TAs. No previous knowledge is required, and a lot will be gained throughout the course. Grading is fair, and homework is fairly light, though there is a good amount of reading required. The midterm was very fair, and the class really helps you practice your critical thinking skills. Not to mention Susie Phillips is just a fantastic, intelligent, and very emotionally invested teacher who really just wants you to learn and become a better person. A great use of your quarter.
I am so happy to have taken this class because I think it really challenged my analytical skills. Since I am a freshman, I am now interested in possibly pursuing an English major because of Intro to Shakespeare.
Professor Philips has a great way of making something that could be dry in the hands of another professor vastly intriguing. The class is very fair: if you read the plays, you will do well. The papers, while challenging, were never a burden. My biggest complaint would be the time constraint the midterm and final exams put you under: there simply was not enough time for majority of the class to finish their midterms.
I was a fan of the in-class discussions and thought they were an insightful companion to the texts. However, as I am not a skilled writer, I found the writing sections very stressful.
A great range of Shakespeare's plays in one quarter and Prof. Phillips is an amazing lecturer. However, between the readings, watching the film versions, 2 papers, and exams, I found that the course took much more of my time than I expected.

I learned a lot about John Milton from someone who is passionate about his writings and has devoted her career to her.
Prof. Schwartz is extremely knowledgable about Paradise Lost and all of Milton's writings. Most of the class consisted of her going over all the readings, which was really helpful because Paradise Lost is incredibly dense. Overall workload wasn't too bad either, 3-page midterm paper, 8-10 final paper and a presentation during the quarter. The whole class had a very laid back feel, which wasn't what I expected going into a class about John Milton.
1 midterm paper (3 pages), 1 final paper (8-10pg), 1 oral report. Not too much work, which left a lot of time to focus on the text.
What you takeaway from the course is proportional to the effort you put in. Schwartz is an expert in Milton and really helps to unpack the density of Paradise Lost. Whereas I derived a lot of value from the theological explanations of MIlton's perspective, I can't say I improved a ton as a student.
If you are in any way interested in reading Paradise Lost, take this class with Prof. Schwartz. She is insanely knowledgeable of Milton and his works, and also quite nice, and as a result, I found this class to be very rewarding.
Reading paradise lost and understanding it and it's significance.
Prof. Schwartz clearly knows a ton about Milton and has endless insights into Paradise Lost. I was a little annoyed at how often class got derailed by tangential discussions that had little to do with the text. I wish I heard more from Schwartz in class.
Prof. Schwartz is super knowledgable about Milton, and she does a great job of helping you understand it. Not very many assignments other than the reading.
Prof. Schwartz is very knowledgeable about Milton, but I found the class to be a bit dull. The reading schedule was uneven, starting with one book a week, but by midterm season, we had two books of Paradise Lost per week and were getting behind. Ultimately, we had some great theological discussions, but I think Schwartz is a little too close to the material for apt criticism of the work.
Not too much work but very interesting class. I had no idea who Milton was prior to taking this class and he’s actually a super cool dude. Paradise lost was a very dense read, but the professor was super good at explaining what was important to the understanding of the book.
While paradise lost is an amazing book, I did not feel that the instructor taught it in an effective way that made her students want to learn. whenever we expressed our opinions she told us they were wrong if they were not what she believed to be Milton's interpretation, and left no room for opinion.
Great class if you're interested in John Milton or Renaissance literature, everything is well explained and the assignments are straightforward and not too difficult or too easy
Great course, highly recommend. Grading system was fair with 2 papers and a presentation.
A really wonderful class for discussing religion and the ideas presented in the Bible, but not so great if you're looking to engage with Milton's words on a literary level. A lot of the class is just listening to the professor translate that week's reading to you and then some really engaging discussion about the ideas presented in Christian ideology. Not a bad class, but definitely not what I expected.
This was a good course, Paradise Lost was super interesting and the prof was really good at making us understand what was going on. She really knew the book and Milton. I wish it was a little more participation based as a lot of classes are just her talking about the chapters we had to read, which wasn't really that bad since it really helped me understand the book.
Prof. Schwartz is very enthusiastic about teaching this class, but it didn't go as in-depth into literary analysis as I was hoping.

Comments
Professor Schwartz held great discussions that really allowed us to explore the text according to our own interpretations. She is so knowledgeable about the text that she was able to really help us advance our own understandings. The supplementary texts are intriguing and very helpful.
Take this class. It is easy, with a very light workload. 20-30 pages of reading a week, one 3 page midterm paper, and one 10 page final paper. Half the time I left class, I didn't have homework. Plus, Prof Schwartz is very passionate about Milton. Even if you have no understanding of the Bible or Genesis, she makes the work approachable. If you need a 300 level pre-1830 English class, take this one. It's pretty painless.
I loved taking this class. Professor Schwartz has so much expertise; she really teaches you how to appreciate Milton. She helps you understand difficult passages and love them even more. There were so many moments when I read something and was just in awe of how Milton could write so perfectly. My only complaint is that you don't get letter grades on your assignments, so you won't know how you're performing until final grades come out.
Professor Schwartz is simply one of the best (and kindest) humanities professors Northwestern has. Taking Milton with her was an invaluable experience!
I really enjoyed this course. Not too much work, fun discussions.
