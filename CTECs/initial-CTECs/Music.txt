Comments
Not a lot of work outside of class, lots of workshopping and group work in class... Dr. P was really helpful
Nice hands on approach.
It is pretty cool, ultimately, that I was able to compose a basic canon with embellishments at the end. It found it pretty exciting.
I love this class and I have learned so much in it.
I never knew much about music theory before taking this course so it was really interesting to relate it back to playing my instrument. Dr. P. is a very genuine and awesome teacher. She really cares about her students a lot and is passionate about teaching. she makes what would otherwise be a very boring course, very interesting!
This is a class that teaches you the building blocks of music which will help you with any music related degree, not just performance or education.
Loved it
I really enjoyed this course. The skills test helped me identify the intervals and stuff very fast so I don't have to count out the steps. It also went over canons and counterpoint.

Comments
Several rules such as the note-to-note writing and factors of beautiful melodic lines are important for me to understand 16th century music better.
I loved this class. It was a very fair amount of work for a half credit class. Kenn is very engaging and seems to enjoy theory and teaching. At the beginning of the quarter, I was so bored with two voices and I didn't see any applications. But, once we got into 3 voices, things became more interesting and my compositions started to sound like music. I'm also just a theory nerd, so that's part of the reason I liked this class so much.
I truly loved all aspects of this class. The inside and outside of class work was very doable yet challenging. The projects and compositions or fun and I felt that I learned a lot from doing them. I was surprised by the depth of the quality of education at the professor provided.
Kenn Kumpf makes this counterpoint something that I legitimately wanted to learn more about, and he presents the material in a fun and interesting way. He is clearly committed to this class, and it's almost hard to imagine him doing anything else.
This course was a challenge but a lot of fun.
Although theory isn't my favorite class, I have learned to appreciate it and had lots of fun writing my own compositions.
I felt satisfied to learn counterpoint because I feel that it did have significance in my interpretation of music
Really fun and interesting difficult but well explained
Wouldn't be good if not very interested because of all the work but if are then really enjoy
good instructor. hope he could emphasize more on what's important and what's not. sometimes the lines are pretty blurry
Learn how to do counterpoint and get good at it!

Comments
Rosenberg is very knowledgeable and an engaging lecturer. He tells you exactly what he wants on exams and papers. Also he wants everyone to succeed
Rosenberg is a very good lecturer - he manages to captivate his students with his calm voice and extraordinary demonstrations of concepts at the piano. I enjoyed the topics of his class very much, and feel that this will probable be the most lax course out of the music history sequence.
This class was one of the least stimulating course I have taken at Northwestern. Prof. Rosenberg's lectures were often filled with self-serving intellectual questionings without any clear point or drawn historical narrative.
Unfortunately, I did not find that I was introduced to many new topics in this course -- it focused mainly on repertoire, and I was already familiar with the majority of what was covered. I wish that the course had focused more on compositional trends and historical events that occurred during the period.
Professor Rosenberg is excellent! Workload is very light and grading system is fair.
When Rosenberg talks, I enter another dimension. Stingy with the lecture notes though.
Rosenberg is an utterly lovely man. He provides a very fresh spin on historical concepts and always entertains as well as educates.
Filled with asinine assessments designed to test how well you can memorize and promptly forget information. Deeply irritating grading policies (eg. taking 10% off of virtually everyone in the class for double spacing an assignment where we were not told to single space), and not enough depth in any of the content to actually be interesting.
I felt that I learned very little in this course. The fact that we were quizzed on things like Chicago Citations and Musical Catalogues didn't help at all.
Professor Rosenberg is definitely a great professor. Of course, the material itself is pretty dry and boring, but he makes the class bearable. The grade distribution is pretty clear, and it's definitely an almost guaranteed A- or A if you study for the quizzes. He gives you what to study for the quizzes, so make sure you study those. The worst part of this entire course is the final research paper which is 8-10 pages. Unfortunately, we didn't really get any guidance on the paper. It's only worth 15% of our grade, but still, it would have been nice to have a bit more guidance on choosing our topics or for research. The final is take-home, and you can pretty much answer all of the questions as long as you do some of the readings and pay marginal attention in class.
Very manageable course - the more notes you take in class the easier the assignments will be.

Comments
The class is very structured so I really liked it. There are weekly listening quiz which can get VERY HARD.
It was really nice to have all the lectures so organized and easy for me to follow. Studying for assessments was pretty straightforward thanks to Professor Talle.
It was ok
Good course; Talle did a good job condensing two centuries into one quarter. The readings and listenings are well-organized and make sense, there are just so many of them. Lectures were great
Great professor, very interesting lectures.
This definitely felt like the first year Talle taught this class (there were more than a few kinks) but he is a really great lecturer and picks interesting topics to discuss. Definitely worth taking over the other teacher.
I really enjoyed this class although there is a lot of work to do. I learned a lot in this class and I enjoyed the lecture overall. It is very interesting to see how pieces that are equally famous during the time ends up differently now. Just make sure you don't fall behind on the reading.
I would have liked to focus more on instrumental music rather than opera, since we did a lot of opera. I was mostly interested in the stories and the lives of the composers we come across all the time in our industries, but I found myself most concerned with the listening quizzes. I did learn a lot from listening, even with the overwhelming amount we had to do, but I still would have liked to learn more about the historical influences on certain instrumental composers.
Professor Talle is an extremely passionate teacher, always trying to engage students through added humor and tangents. He truly cares about them and is always trying to improve the class structure
Expect a listening and analysis course not a history course.
The amount of reading and listening really is a lot, but the work you are putting in really does help you learn. If you do not put in the time, however, it is really easy to fall behind and get bad grades on quizzes. Everything that appears on quizzes and tests are things that we clearly went over or were indicated that they are things we should know about. No surprises.

Comments
This course emphasizes lifestyle techniques that will help in movement, being stationary, and in any activity we pursue. The unnecessary tensions are recognized and we learn to "let go" of those tensions, bringing our body into a more correct alignment for more effective function. This technique is also helpful for performing.
Very low key but also didn't learn anything that helped me improve my performance which is disappointing.
