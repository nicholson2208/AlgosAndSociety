Overall I felt that the course was not very challenging, nor very interesting. Professor D'Onofrio was very helpful and engaging.
This class is the best class I've taken so far here at NU. Honestly, with all my STEM classes it was really nice to have this nice, easier class to go to. The workload is minimal, and if you're juggling Bio and Orgo in the same quarter it's a blessing. The material is really interesting too, and good for a first Linguistics class. There is an experimental requirement, but only 2 experiments (2 hours). Annette is the best! Seriously, she's so chill and an amazing professor.
One of my favorite courses at NU! It's a relatively easy course, but all the material is very applicable and interesting. D'Onofrio is so engaging and approachable!
interesting class but hard graders
Great distro!! Annette is so cute and I loved her.
This was a great class! Annette is the coolest, and she really knows her stuff. The material is very engaging and relevant to current society. After taking this class, I look at language use (mine and others') differently and I think knowledge of sociolinguistics is an important part of an education for anybody who is interested in social justice or social policy.
This was a pretty easy course. There was not a lot of work, and I got to learn a lot about how language and society interact.
This course is interesting because you truly understand the role of language in society and how sociolinguistic variables index certain social meanings that can explain why society has these views. It isn't too time consuming on a weekly basis with only about 50 pages of reading a week and a two-paragraph reading response every week. The linguistic analysis were interesting and something I had never done before. The Quantitative Data Analysis Assignment was specifically difficult because it is the first one and you dont really know what they are looking for. The next one is on Style and is much easier. The final paper is difficult and took a very long time but overall the course was fine.
This course is very interesting and Prof is really good at filling the time so, although it's a long lecture-style class, it almost never drags. I definitely recommend doing the readings over the weekend before they're due because the 5:00 deadline is easy to forget about until the day of and 30 pages is too much to cram. The class is really what you make it but Annette is engaging and is quite reasonable with the assignment expectations.
Not only was this class informative, it was also a lot of fun. The class discussions were intriguing and provided a lot of perspective on language that I wouldn't have had otherwise, and the assignments helped me learn a lot about how to write research papers.
The class felt more like a large discussion period with some academic material rather than a lecture, which made it super enjoyable. If you're interested in anything related to sociology and curious into how linguistics plays a role- definitely take this class. Assignments are all super doable and the 2 papers during the quarter (including the final paper) are as well.
This class was great. Prof. D'Onofrio is really nice and excited to teach. This class is really easy, one paragraph reading response a week. Two midterm essays and one final essay. Interesting subject matter.
I loved this course. I took this class for fun and it did not disappoint. Professor D'Onofrio is great.
Really great class, interesting topics, cool professor, and great discussions about relevant topics regarding language as an identity marker for age, race, gender, orientation, social class, etc.
I LOVED this class. The readings were engaging, the lectures were interesting, and the professor is great! It's eye-opening to look at how language affects society and vice versa, and I recommend this class to everyone. The projects and papers we had to do took a bit of time but were worth it because they were so cool and not ordinary research papers.
I believe that the course helped me observe linguistic phenomenon in a new light, exposing me to issues that I hadn't considered before from both a linguistic and social view point. The instruction in the class was done very well, and I learned a lot from both the readings and the class lectures.
Incredibly easy and still interesting. Gets repetitive, but D'Onofrio is a gem. I wouldn't take this class if she wasn't teaching it, but if she is, Iɽ say this is a fun, easy distro.
A solid course. Well taught and interesting material. Workload not bad
If you have any interest in linguistics take this class!! It's not a heavy workload although the projects can be time consuming. Most of the readings were enjoyable and supplemented what we talked about in class. Annette is a great professor!
This course gave me a much deeper understanding of some topics I knew a little about already, and raises some very interesting points on social justice concerns.
I definitely recommend this course if you are at all interested in the way people talk, because it is very cool to see a linguistic explanation of why people talk the way they do.
This class was somewhat interesting and not that challenging. I thought the readings and the materials that had to do with society today were interesting, but some of the other materials were dense and boring. Overall, an easy distro that doesn't require prior knowledge on the subject.
Annette is a great Professor! Passionate about linguistics and makes class interesting and fun.

Comments
I was most interested in seeing the sentence structure and learning more on that, though I still was confused after class. The handouts do help out a lot in giving examples, many of which are explained during class. I do recommend this class for a distribution requirement, as it is not exactly easy, still challenging, but still easy enough to get through it without worrying to much about homework load and time needed to complete it.
Was not excited to take this class as am not a math person but it was completely manageable and I feel like I learned a lot. The only annoying part of the class is that you have to turn assignments in through a computer, you can't turn in any form of hand written work and that is annoying when you have to make a ton of trees that can be very time consuming .
It was an okay distro for formal studies. You have to be prepared to actually go to class and put a lot of time into the assignments, but thankfully there weren't a lot of them.
go to lecture!! even though it is super boring you need to go to lecture to do well on the four take home assignments and take home final.
Not a good class. Went in interested in exploring a new area, but was just disappointed. Would not recommend.
Interesting course overall. I took it as a distro and enjoyed it. Masaya is a good teacher, and you don't need a book for his class which is a big plus.
This class was really interesting, with a lot of cool material that will blow your mind a little bit because it's stuff you would never think about on your own. Masaya is great, and he makes lecture fun with all his bad jokes. He's also amazing at explaining things in different ways for people who don't understand them and has never-ending patience in his willingness to explain. Read the handouts he posts on Canvas BEFORE class, and everything will make much more sense; even if you don't understand it in writing, the professor will explain it and you'll be less confused because you at least primed yourself for the info.
The material was interesting, but the course felt disorganized and some of the homework assignments were unreasonably hard.
Although this class is interesting, I would not recommend taking it under any circumstances unless the homework format is changed. Masaya only accepts computer drawn word trees that take hours to create, even when the conceptual work is straightforward. It's an enormous waste of time on a class that I actually would have enjoyed otherwise.
It was a casual and easy distribution requirement, I have gotten nothing out of it.
I liked Professor Masaya, and he did his best to explain each topic to us. He would ask us repeatedly if we understood before moving on to a new topic. However, by the end of the term, everything had gotten very, very complicated, and it's really easy to make small mistakes on the homework and exam that add up to a lot of missed points. I liked the lecture, but the last two homework assignments and the exam were very difficult.
not as easy as expected
The content got really confusing a lot of times, and the professor was not really helpful in the class. I found self-studying via handouts and the text book more effective. It was good to have all the assignments taken home, but they were extremely time-consuming and emotionally exhausting.
tree diagrams are awful but this class is pretty cool. Masaya is super cool and a great professor. the English language is trippy, yɺll.
The course only gets challenging towards the end -- the last homework assignment (before the final) took me nearly 10 hours, but most others took me closer to 3 or 4. The most time-filling part of this class is making all those trees. The subject is not inherently interesting, but Yoshida is engaging and it fills a distribution requirement.
It seems really easy for the first half of the quarter, but the last homework and the final are pretty difficult. Masaya is a fun teacher, but so much of the class is spent answering student questions that aren't that helpful. You don't have to go to all the lectures.
Really interesting class, but not an easy distro at all. Take it if you think you can handle taking a more scientific approach to language, not if you're looking to improve on your English skills.
I took this course as a Math/Science distro. It started off fine but then I would just get bored in class and zone out. The homeworks, although there are few, probably took me over 12 hours to complete. Each tree drawing took me 30-40 minutes to draw. The last homework was the worst. I never will use this learning in my everyday life so I am not too stressed about it.
Masaya is a KOOKY guy but also a really fun lecturer. I have never been in a room of so many confused people that are also still interested in what the lecturer is saying. Except for the guy that sat in front of me every day and wrote a novel on his computer. It's not a bad plot, tbh.
It was near impossible to learn anything in this class as the class time was exceptionally tedious. At first the homework was very simple and could be completed just by looking at the additional handouts, the fourth homework assignment completely out of left field and literally took me twelve hours to complete. It was also due the Saturday of thanksgiving break. I really struggled to understand the latter half of this course.
I wish there would have been a book or source to reference other than a somewhat-jumbled course pack.
Daunting homework assignments, but reasonable experiment requirements.
If you're not a math person, this is the perfect class for a formal studies distro. 4 homework assignments, no midterm, and take home final
This was an extremely frustrating course for me. This may just have been my case, but I had a very hard time understanding the concepts taught in the class. Masaya is a nice and funny professor, and maybe other students knew what they were doing, but after attending all the lectures, taking pages of notes, and attending both TA's office hours, I still had no clue what was going on and felt stressed out and frustrated while doing each homework assignment.
Honestly, I forgot I was taking this class most of the time. There was so little work to do outside of class. I found most classes to be slow and got bored, but I know other people really enjoyed the pace.
I learned that language highly relied on its structures. The class was more like exploring different language phenomena together than listening to a lecture.
All of the assignments were take-home, including the final, which I found convenient. The online handouts were very useful in completing the homeworks but I would definitely recommend attending and taking notes during the lectures in order to get the most out of the course.
I'm interested in linguistics, so I appreciated the discussions on sentence and word formation. I felt like what we were doing was solving logic puzzles the whole time, and, if that's not your thing, Iɽ take a pass on this class. Some of the concepts are difficult to grasp if you've never thought about things like "why is language the way it is?"
I will not be taking a linguistics course again because it is really confusing and unnecessary, but I enjoyed it to an extent. Masaya is super cool and you will get lost if you don't go to lecture, so it's definitely worth coming to class.
Straightforward course - there's nothing unexpected on the homework or final. Notes are given out at the start of the course and Prof goes over all of them in the lectures. Notes are good but not extensive, so go to office hours. This class is easy if you put in the effort and attend the lectures.
The lectures were informative and well structured. However, I was frustrated that the material taught was not founded in concrete, current materials. This made it difficult to research˾xpand upon what was taught in class outside of class. Overall, a great intro class for anybody interested in linguistics.
Lectures were so bad. Could not see where anything was going at all. Notes provided on canvas were virtually no help. Impossible to follow what they mean.
I enjoyed this course. However, I think that had more to do with the professor than the course content and structure, and I will say that the last two homework assignments were probably the most difficult assignments I've ever done. Also please please PLEASE let students turn in tree diagrams on paper!!! I cannot say this enough: I think the homework assignments would have taken half the time if we were allowed to hand-draw tree diagrams.
I thought this was a very interesting class which was extremely important for an understanding of linguistics.
There were days I really enjoyed this class and felt like I was learning a lot, and there were days when I didn't like it as much and thought the instruction could have been clearer. It was a good distribution requirement that was for the most part not too hard, but I do not think I will take more linguistics classes.
This course was frustrating. The instructional materials were a bit difficult to follow. The class didn't seem to follow a clear structure which made the content more difficult to understand.
The class was pretty technical but, overall, you can get by on the class notes.
I did not enjoy this course. I came in interested in linguistics but left hating it.
Extremely interesting course - didn't know much about Linguistics beforehand but learned a lot. Masaya was a fantastic prof and him and the TAs explained key concepts well. Only a few assignments due, but they are time consuming so don't wait until the last minute. The first few weeks of the course may give you a false sense of security but there's definitely a difficulty spike around the halfway point where a lot of people wind up dropping. As long as you go to class and take notes you should be able to keep up, though.
I hated this class so much. Really REALLy uninteresting like painfully boring and has no application in the real world, which they tell you at the beginning but still. Masaya is funny but unhelpful in answering questions. Always has too much going on on the board and poses questions that NEVER get answered. So boring, sososo sBORING, boring
pretty interesting goes into enough depth for an intro class professor great
This was a pretty solid class - a lot harder than I was expecting because apparently he had to make it not an easy A class this year, but it was okay. The lectures were all on a chalkboard/no powerpoint involved which was a bit of an adjustment but I got used to it okay, and he provided lecture packets which were clutch. I would 11⼐ recommend going to class because a lot of the HW questions he actually did in class. A bit boring, but Masaya was relatively entertaining when he wanted to be. The overall structure was 4 assignments and a take home final. The first two were pretty easy; the last 2 and the final were ROUGH so I would recommend starting those early and going to office hours because office hours were the only reason I did well in this class. Go to the TAs' office hours!!!!!!!
There wasn't a ton of work, but the homework were difficult to complete because of how disorganized and unclear the lectures were. Meeting with TAs was helpful, but homework assignments took inordinate amounts of time because of how long it takes to make sentence trees on the computer.
I had no prior knowledge about what linguistics was or how to study it, and I was hoping this class would gauge my interest in the course. The study of why grammar functions the way it does was pretty interesting, but I needed an engaging teacher to help me, and I assume, other individuals unfamiliar with the subject, with the material. I did not get that - I can tell the professor understands linguistics and gets a grasp on it, but his explanations to the class were presented in a very broken and confusing manner. Oftentimes, it was not clear what he was saying or trying to explain, and I could tell the class was scared to ask clarifying questions for fear of further confusion. The only thing driving me to complete the course at the end of the quarter was to be done with the distribution requirement.
A fine lecture but terrible presentation of content especially in the homework.
Would not recommend this course with this instructor. He is clearly brilliant, but the topics are confusing under the best of circumstances, and his course materials are often unreadable due to their poor syntax even to the point that the written handouts give incorrect instruction. In addition, the few (very confusingly formatted and worded) assignments are graded without sufficient time or information provided for students to learn from what they got wrong.
Okay so: I never went to class. Except the first day. And so honestly, yeah you can get by the quarter without going. BUT be forewarned- the lecture notes are not comprehensive at all (and a lot of times actually it has errors). So you're going to have to supplement your at home learning with videos etc. idk how I did the final but I definitely felt myself wishing Iɽ gone to class the last half of quarter and also taken good notes Bc apparently a lot of the hw/ final examples are written out in class. So is this an easy A? No freaking way (unless there is a curve). But can you get an easy A-˻+ ? For sure- if you're willing to teach yourself material and GO TO OFFICE HOURS. You can't skip class and not go to OH if you want a great grade.
A low stress class that does teach some nice fundamentals of setence trees.
The course was alright, I just found the content extremely boring and unexciting, which made it hard for me to do well.
This course started off okay. The lectures were fairly boring but I'm here for a distro credit so, no harm done there. Prof Yoshida is a funny guy, but there's only so much you can do to liven up word/sentence structure. Things started to go sideways when it came time to do the assignments. IGNORE ALL CTECS SAYING YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO LECTURE. They changed the course content to make it harder and if you blow off lecture you will be screwed six ways to Sunday. Why? Because the notes posted online have gigantic content gaps in them, and what is posted is not always the easiest thing to decipher. Simply put: everything that's due for the class is posted on day one, but you will not do well on the later assignments/the final if you fail to attend lecture. Not to mention that they will take you hours to complete. This is definitely not the easy A it apparently once was.
Super interesting class, time-consuming homework.
The material was relatively interesting, but the professor doesn't explain the concepts very well, and the course packets he gave out were unclear. However, the workload was fair, and as long as you keep up, you'll do fine.
This course was interesting. It really helps you to think about language in a different way. If you go to the lectures, the material is all very doable and logical. The professor genuinely wants to help students understand the material and will always answer any questions you have!! This is a great class to take if you're somewhat interested in linguistics or want to learn more about how it works.
The beginning of this course is easy and the first few homework were not bad at all. However, around week 6 or 7, the course got impossibly difficult and the problems that were done in class and in the notes did not match the homework problems at all.
Very hard, really difficult to understand materials, unorganized, and not practical or intuitive at all. The only saving grace is Professor Masaya, he's hilarious and very smart but there is little to no support to learn the material.
This class could get pretty dreary at times, but it is important to go to class and take notes because a lot of the trees he draws in class are very helpful in answering the homework questions. I'm not sure how helpful recording would be. It is SOO important to stay current on the worksheets and make sure you understand them because they are basically all you need to answer homework and they are very helpful (maybe even more than the lecture) in making you understand the logical flow of arguments he uses to build up concepts. Apart from this, this class is pretty non-stressful. All your grade is just take home assignments.
interesting course; many tree diagrams

Leddon is AWESOME I loved this class because the content was interesting, and she always found a way to bring it back to current day events
A very thought provoking and useful course
I really enjoyed this class! never taken a linguistics but that is absolutely not necessary for this class. Erin is a great professor. Quizzes and exams are very straightforward. Lectures were not too bad. i actually enjoyed going to this class!
It's a great class with an AMAZING professor, but there are some drawbacks. There are too many readings -- you can get by with just skimming them though. Realistically by the end I wasn't doing readings and just studying powerpoints. That seemed sufficient for at least a B+˺-. It helps to just have a basic understanding of prejudice before (like from PA training or something). The format is one midterm exam, one final exam, two research briefs (Like 4-5 page essays), and two quizzes. You also have to submit reaction thoughts before every class which is ljust a short comment on the reading with a question or two
TAKE THIS CLASS. Grading is super fair, if you put in minimal effort and study a little, it's very easy to get an A. Also, the material is super interesting, and i'm even considering a minor in linguistics now. Highly recommend this class to everyone
This class had some cool topics so I thought it was fine
Literally easiest A I've ever gotten--never did reading or homework and aced stuff
Learned a lot about language and language use in general.
The things I learned in this class were very applicable to the real world. The readings can be a lot but can be skimmed for sure. The tests are very fair and clear. The research briefs were interesting to write, and did not take that long to do. I really enjoyed this course! Prof Leddon is amazing too!
This is a really good class to take, especially as a distro. Professor Leddon is really enthusiastic and the actual content of the lectures is interesting and the workload is definitely manageable.
Professor Leddon is great! She puts a lot of information on the lecture slides so if you miss class it's not a big deal, but class is interesting and going definitely makes it easy to do well on the exams! Great distro.
This class is an incredibly easy, low-time commitment distro˾lective. Prof. Leddon is very helpful and engaging, and the class material is thought provoking and interesting. This is a great class.
This class is boring but really easy. You don't have to do the reading or even really come to class, all she does is read off the powerpoints word for word and she posts the powerpoints online- so if you just study those you're fine. Take Ling 220 Language and Society with Annette D'Onofrio for a much more interesting and engaging course of similar material.
Great class! Super interesting. Not a cake walk, but if you do the readings and go to class you'll do well. Professor Leddon is incredibly knowledgeable on the topic, passionate about what she teaches, and really wants students to enjoy and do well in the class. Highly recommend.
I wanted to learn about the power of words in perpetuating inequality, and the course provided some insight into this, especially in areas that I had never even considered a possible source of contention
Easy class but a lot of reading
What I was most interested in was learning how much of an impact language has in society. People always think of prejudice in race and religion, but there is also prejudice in language.
This class is rather basic, and the texts are informational, so it can be rather pedantic as opposed to having interesting discussion. VERY easy to do well, but the exams take themselves too seriously.
Professor Leddon did a great job at teaching us the basics of linguistics and how the topic we are learning can be applied to our everyday lives. She is genuinely concerned with how each of her students are doing and makes an effort to remember our names. She is by far the most approachable professor I have met and I would love to take another course with her. Her exams are fair and not challenging at all if you attend her lectures and review her slides. Overall, this was a great class that definitely made an impact on my college career and life.
Amazing and interesting class. The second half of the quarter is a little more technical...
Great class! Professor Leddon is very engaging and uses relevant examples. The materials were helpful for my understanding. The exams and quizzes are pretty straightforward - if you come to lecture, pay attention, and review the slides you'll probably do pretty well
A great distribution requirement -- it will teach you to become socially aware of how language affects different aspects of everyday life.
Class materials are interesting, but it seems the evaluation methods are rather bad. The two exams and quizzes became "memorization of slides" instead of grasping the material and build up on them. Perhaps writing papers would be a better choice.
This class will very possibly change the way you think about language and how it interacts with our day-to-day life. I highly recommend it.

this class is very interesting but can be a bit slow moving. but professor gundlach is the best and you will definitely improve your writing skills.
Professor Gundlach is the epitome of effective and meaningful teaching. He always uses class time well and is engaged with the class and his students, and following the nature of this course, gives a voice to all his students in class and also through the topics that they wish to pursue. I really enjoyed this first-year seminar.
This is such a good seminar! Professor really tries to help with your writing and provides valuable feedback. Is a lot of work in the beginning but mellows out a lot around midterms season. Class could get a little boring because professor really likes to talk but honestly wasn't that bad. Definitely recommend
This class was a lot more work than I expected it be. There is a lot of reading to do, several essays to write, and a decent amount of busy work. Professor Gundlach was a very good professor and very wholesome, and the class content is super interesting, but it was a decent amount of work.
Lots of readings in first half of course. Second half was more writing focused. Lots of essay revision, so this is not good for anyone who like to just write the paper the night before, but expect to get better at writing. Prof clearly cares about students, but talks like he's leading some kind of group meditation with lots of flowery language (idk how else to describe it) and each class period is very structured with little room for open discussion about the material.
This is hands down the best class I've taken at Northwestern. This is the first teacher I've had that actually cared about his students as well as their progress in the course. He wanted to see every student improve. If you put forth your full effort in this class, there is no doubt you will succeed. At Northwestern, Iɽ had some bad experiences with previous writing teachers, however, this teacher truly made me feel confident about my writing abilities again. Iɽ highly recommend taking this course. I learned so much about the writing process, and I can actually say that my writing improved under Professor Gundlach's guidance. Furthermore, class discussion was always stimulating. I loved how much interest Professor Gundlach showed in topics that interested each and every one of the students. This was the most enjoyable class I've taken as well as the class in which I learned the most.
Great class! Really opened my eyes to college-level writing. Would definitely recommend.
This is my favorite course so far!!! Prof. Gundlach is an amazing instructor and his seminar has the perfect balance between the theoretical side of voice in the beginning of the class and the voice that you want to explore as a writer taking a linguistics class. You get so much freedom with your essays and can pursue whatever excites you the most! The class environment is very friendly as well. I strongly recommend this course, even if you are not super interested in linguistics. What you will get out of the class experience depends entirely on you and Prof. Gundlach is only going to help you figure out what you want to write about and what will work best for you as a writer. I just loved the class.
This seminar was very interesting and wasn't too much work. Also, Prof. Gundlach is a great teacher and is really good at making students better writers. Regardless of your current writing ability, he will work with you in conferences and in class in order to give you the tools to make it that much better. Highly recommend putting this one towards the top of your list.
Professor Gundlach was so kind and accommodating. He's always there to help students. Offers honest feedback and advice. Really cares for the students and their growth. Learned valuable lessons regarding the writing process.
Professor Gundlach was amazing. He's so genuinely enthusiastic about the subject, and really pushed students to do their best work and writing. The course is more writing focused, with a nice amount of linguistics thrown in, but it's really interesting regardless. P. Gundlach is super understanding, and wants students to succeed. You have to put work into this class, but he makes it very enjoyable to do so. Overall, a very rewarding course.
This course is a pretty basic first-year seminar. It mainly consists of readings, class discussions and essay writing. Professor Gundlach is incredibly nice and obviously very passionate about what he teaches. The classes might get a bit dull as the professor is very soft-spoken, but overall the class was pretty nice.
This was one of my favorite courses at NU. Professor Gundlach is wonderful—he really engaged the class in discussions and was available and accessible for questions and essay writing guidance outside of class. The class has four essay assignments, culminating in a self-driven research paper on a topic of your choice. Because of the research and writing experience in this course, I feel well-equipped and confident to go on and pursue research papers in othe classes. The subject matter is also fascinating and very far-reaching—you’d be surprised how much applies to the human voice (music, writing, creativity, artificial intelligence, doctor-patient relationships, and more!). I loved this class!
This was a very interesting course where I got to take control on what I wanted to learn about and become a better writer. Professor Gundlach is one of the nicest teachers I've ever had and made the class both valuable and interesting

Interesting readings˽iscussions and frequent writing.
This was a great class. There was a ton of information that was conveyed and sometimes the lectures seemed to ramble a little bit, but the breadth on information related to bilingualism was awesome and the weekly write-ups and discussions were super helpful in processing the information. Would definitely recommend to anyone with an interest in Cog Sci or Linguistics.
I think that the course helped me read linguistics studies more effectively and be able to understand them rather than just regurgitate the information and learn about the neuro aspect of bilingualism
Very easy course with clear expectations and routine; no exams, just weekly written assignments and a final group paper; but because we spent the entire quarter just discussing different research studies, I really don't feel like I learned much
I really enjoyed this class! The first few weeks weren't very challenging but the course definitely gets harder as the quarter progresses. Very manageable workload and Prof Cibelli is very reasonable and understanding of students' needs.
Half the lectures (one day out of two days per week) are discussions in small groups about the paper we read for homework. I am not really sure the meaning behind this but it seems if we used the time for another lecture we could have learned twice as much.
Emily is great! The structure of the course was pretty good, with lectures on one day and discussion of the readings the next day. The studies and topics were interesting. Only assignments were weekly writing assignments and a final group paper.
this class with emily cibelli is amazing (but she isn't teaching anymore). it's not a difficult class. don't need to pay too much attention to lectures because all the homework is reading scientific articles and summarizing them. no tests. final group project which is obnoxious, but very interesting if you DO pay attention.
This course covered a wide range of subtopics related to bilingualism, which is a great introduction to anyone interested in this field.
To be honest I didn't love the professor at first. The pace of this class is pretty slow - it's kind of frustrating when the professor spends fifty (50) minutes on the first day of class going over the syllabus. That being said, she was really, really clear about expectations, which I guess is nice. I liked the discussions we had every Thursday, but I also felt like we weren't covering as much material as I had hoped to because of that. There really wasn't that much work for this class. We had a group final, which I thought would be terrible but ended up being a fantastic experience. The professor grew on me over time. She's really great at facilitating discussion and answering questions, and her lectures are really engaging (most of them). Also her fashion sense is A+ on point all the time. A really interesting class!
