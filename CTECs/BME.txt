Comments
The teacher did a good job of teaching the information from the book. My main issue from the class was that the textbook just didn't feel completely appropriate for the subject of the course. With the current textbook and teaching style, this felt like a good freshman-level course. However, as an upperclassman, it felt a little bit easy⾺sic.
Lecture notes were not going to be put up on canvas SO I went to basically every single lecture. They are extremely boring lectures, and you will find yourself writing down and being told the same equation over 50 times. Lectures are based exactly off of the book, but lecture does not do anything to supplement the book material. Furthermore, reading the book is more interesting˾ngaging/understandable than lectures. You do not really learn anything new until the last two weeks of the class.
Class was okay. Homework was hard - needed assistance from TA's during discussion almost every week to do it. Lecture went at a good pace. Lots of repetition to lock in concepts
It was the instructors first time presenting this course so it wasn't perfect, but it was pretty well organized. Too many notes to take down made it hard to understand lecture.
I enjoyed this course more than I thought I ever would and think it will prove to be very helpful in engineering applications
There are a lot of parts of lecture that can be improved to help students in general. For example, the amount of writing that is expected during class makes it unable for a lot of students to comprehend what they are reading.
This course was very interesting but the material was very hard. It is important to keep up with day to day lectures and lessons and make sure you understand them; otherwise, you will fall behind and will perform poorly on exams.The problem sets are meant to be very challenging but if you try to get through them yourself and give yourself enough time throughout the week to do it - and not procrastinate - it will be very much worth it in the end.
Professor Kamat is a great teacher. She cares about her students and makes the class entertaining and informative.
Good class, not too challenging. Final was pretty difficult though, would recommend studying well in advance for it.
Professor Kamat is very kind and relatable. Do the homework, and you will be fine. Go to the discussion section for help on the homework. The TAs are very chill and helpful. For exams, you have to effectively pace yourself, because you can be very pressed for time.
It was a very fair course where the homeworks were pretty hard but the test were extremely fair. Kamat was a great teacher and gave very useful notes during class. You had to go to class or else you wouldn't get good notes. The book is kinda hard to read so going to class is preferred. There is also a 2 hour discussion section where the TAs hang out to answer questions. This was super nice because I would just do my weekly homework there.
This course started off really easy, but escalated in complexity throughout the quarter. This class improved my problem-solving skills.
You have to write a lot as there are no lecture slides available, the homework wasn't easy and took a lot of time, the exams were not that bad and you get a cheat sheet
At first, I thought this class was difficult and boring. It got much more interesting as the quarter went by and the problems became sort of fun to solve. I definitely recommend putting full effort into the problem sets. They are much more difficult than exams, so if you learn through the problem sets, you'll be set for the exams.
It was definitely hard (esp. homeworks) but reasonable
This class is not bad, homework assignments take a while but are not challenging. Second half of the course picks up speed.
Pretty low-paced and boring class. Homework took a lot of time to finish. Discussion session was very helpful for homework questions. Lecture notes are not posted, so you have to go to class
Homeworks took literally forever but the prof is so sweet I can't even be mad about it. Tbh not sure how much thermo is actually being taught? Seems like the class is structured really differently than it has been in the past. But all in all a pretty reasonable class.
The material and first midterm started off ridiculously easy, but then got way harder for the second midterm. Kamat writes really fast so it's sometime hard to keep up
Weekly homework is time consuming but the material is pretty straightforward. Tests are harder than they should be but manageable
This course overall was a good course. The homework took a really long time, but the discussion section was VERY VERY helpful. The midterms were reasonable; midterm one was VERY easy but midterm two was decently hard. The final was extremely hard, however. The professor is very approachable and teaches the material very well, but the final exam was definitely on a whole new level of difficulty.
I think the material was outlined very well in class. I thought the teacher adjusted well to the class to improve the learning experience.
Great course, great lectures, and amazing TA's! Difficult, but if you take time on the HW, studying for the test is much easier.
Great professor, homework took a long time, but exams were reasonable.
This class is great! Professor Kamat is a great lecturer and has really fair tests. The homeworks are time consuming, but the exams are definitely doable!
Not that hard for a core BME class. Just stay on top of the work. Midterms were not unexpected, homeworks prepare you for them.
Prof. Kamat ROCKS and actually makes this subject interesting. Everything is super clear and she's always checking in to make sure students understand.
SET ASIDE A LOT OF TIME FOR PROBLEM SETS. The TAs guide you a little bit in discussion sections, but you're not going to learn how to setup a problem by following what the TAs say to do.
I really enjoyed taking this course. I think it was particularly interesting because the course of BME specific with BME applications. I generally had a lot of fun from the lectures to even solving the problems.
Really easy but it did not seem much like thermo. Seemed to be an intro to bioengineering class not a intro to thermo class. Professor was great though and really seemed to care about the students and wanted us to learn and do well in the course. A good teacher
I was really nervous about thermodynamics prior to this course. Professor Kamat is extremely approachable and made the course material very manageable.
I really loved this class!!! The professor was amazing and really invested in making sure everyone understood the material! She's definitely better when she's prepared (gets a little frazzled when asked about things she wasn't prepared for), but overall she was wonderful. Second exam definitely way harder than the first, but the final was relatively fair, so (I think) it works out okay. Also, make sure to start the hw early - it's definitely VERY time consuming! Still would recommend taking this class with her though!
This professor (Kamat) is young, new, and sweet, but her teaching methods are boring. Basically, just jam all the formulas onto your cheat sheet for the midterms and you'll be fine. However, the weekly problem sets take FOREVER, like 8 hours. Not a great class, but you'll get a good grade if you put in the hours.
Great course! This is the first BME major course that actually felt applicable to future careers. If you get Professor Kamat, she is amazing and you will love her!
Prof. Nekat is so nice and makes everything really easy for you to understand. Slower pace than most NU classes which was so nice

Comments
I thought that the notes for the class were clear and that studying for tests wasn't hard.
Studying for exams is very difficult because there are no practice exams and no solutions to the textbook problems are provided. You can only really study from old homework problems. The content isn't too difficult; most of the content were ideas I have already learned. Homeworks still take a long time though.
Easy to understand first few weeks but accounting equations need to be fully understood to get through this class. Rely on TAs for hw and exams
dont take this class if you dont have to homework is long and makes no sense because youre given no instruction and class notes are hard to follow because there's so much inconsistency in what she writes
Good class, if you do the homework and go to office hours you should do well. Kamat is super nice, she gets a little confused on some concepts here and there in lecture but overall a pretty good lecturer. She doesn't give enough practice material outside of homework - but her exams are very fair.
Professor Kamat is really great for a new professor. Her class is very fair. The first third of the class was taught really well, the second two thirds of the course got more confusing as the professor would sometimes make mistakes in lecture that made my own notes hard to follow since she didn't post any notes online. Overall, a good class. Thermodynamics sounds scary, but this class is not.
I like.
People always seem to say that thermo classes are really difficult, but I really enjoyed this class. It relies a lot on problem solving and logic; sometimes, the homework can be a bit difficult, but the examples from class help out a lot.
This class is pretty easy. Its mostly just problem solving, but it is useful, and I learned a fair amount. Theres one pset a week that can take up to 8-10 hours on a bad week, but do those well and youll have no problems on the tests.
I was surprised by the homework. Much more difficult than I expected. But if you put the effort into it, it prepared you for the tests very well.
This class covered relationships that were important to know, but the first half of the class didn't feel like there was much content covered, just organization of answers on a page. The second half was much better when we got to energy and fluids. Homework also got more applicable as the course went on- in the beginning, most of the time I spent on problem sets was dedicated to the organization of the answer page.
I was really disappointed in this class. We spent the first 7 weeks learning how to solve glorified systems of equations applied to BME topics. Prof. Kamat is a clear and nice instructor, but I think the course material and homework are so useless. I don't feel like I know more about the world now, just how to deal with tedious equations.
Thermo is a difficult class, and I recommend you utilize the office hours as much as possible. As far as I know, there are only three per week, two of which come in the form of a discussion section, which severely limits your options. Otherwise, you'll be left doing the homework, which has to be the most difficult weekly assignment I've seen while I've been here. Fortunately, the tests are more or less pared-down versions of the homework, which means if you understand the work you'll do fine when it counts. Still, there's going to be a lot of frustrating trial-and-error that you're going to have to prepare for in order to get through most of the class.
Prof. Kamat is great but the course itself is very disappointing. I didn't learn many new things. The course itself is so surface level, and we spend so much time on easy algebra in the earlier part of the course. It is very disappointing that the BME department makes us take such a surface level course for an important subject. Not a good use of time at all.
This is a good class, and its taught really well. It will cover all the basics of thermodynamics from the perspective of Bioengineering. I'm not BME, I'm an environmental engineer, so I was a bit concerned that it would be too focused on human bio processes, and the class itself was not. On the other hand, the textbook problems were, and were also way too long. The homeworks were ridiculously long, often tedious. I blame this on the textbook, which offers long-format problems that just take forever to internalize. That's the worst part of this class. The tests are very fair, but watch out for time constraints. Overall this was a good course, and Professor Kamat was fantastic.
This class was useful, although the text seemed to cover the material in a round-about way much of the time.
The course in general isn't too bad. The weekly homeworks took a lot of time, and was really difficult. The midterms and final were all easier than the hw and tested you on if you actually knew the material, not meant to trick you. As a result, the exams are all pretty fair, but that being said, if you make a mistake on an exam, it is very hard to bounce back since the averages are all very high. Kamat is a good lecturer, but the lectures sometimes felt redundant and unorganized. It's also annoying how the course notes are not posted online so you can not go back and review notes if you do not write them down quickly during the lecture
Pretty good course, homeworks will take you a very long time so try to start them early. Really commit a lot of time to them, they help you study for the exams. Exams are very fair, no real suprises but make sure to know how to do all aspects of the homework. Lecture was rather repetitive and quick (felt as if I was just endlessly copying notes down), was a little ineffective at teaching concepts, often was easier and quicker to just read the book (good textbook).
Overall the course is difficult, but this is mostly due to incredibly high expectations from the professor. Homework is very difficult and it’s not actually graded for completion so make sure you know her grading policies beforehand. The midterms aren’t difficult content-wise but you will run out of time if you haven’t done a million practice problems. Strict professor, but is easier if you do everything.
The professor is very nice and wants students to do well. Homeworks were helpful but longer than necessary. Homework grading was nice that it was only 2. Class expectations or instructions were not always clear, expecially with specific homework problems. Note taking in class made learning difficult.
Lecture does not really help, most of it comes from the textbook. First exam is outrageously easy as compared to the midterm. Professor just copied down notes from one piece of paper to another, and then made mistakes doing so. Also, often didn't have great answers for questions. A lot of the lectures have errors in them, missing negative signs in equations etc. Example problems given in class are hard to follow and not very useful because professor just pulled out numbers and didn't say what question from the book the example was. Also, professor says that 2 homework problems are graded for accuracy while the others are graded for completion, but this isn't the case, they grade them all for accuracy which is wrong. Professor Kamat was really bad at responding to emails in which students asked questions. Also, apparently when asked about how she graded the homework versus what the syllabus said, she responded by saying they reserve the right to grade for completion, so basically when they are lazy or don't feel like grading they can make it for completion. Really fake professor, seems nice and all but isn't very helpful.


Overall, bad course, worse homework assignments, 2nd midterm and final are really hard, read the textbook to get equations and examples, honestly barely have to go to class since she just writes down stuff straight from the textbook and does a worse job explaining it.
Great course, would recommend.
This was a solid course and was more interesting than I expected. Professor Kamat was a good teacher. Tests were graded pretty harshly tho.
This class was okay. The weekly homework was pretty long and tedious, however going to TA office hours is pretty helpful for doing the homework. Kamat made it clear what we needed to know, however she makes so many mistakes in lecture that you won't really understand your notes when you look back at them. Additionally, it was really weird and super annoying that she wouldn't give back our tests to us, instead we had to go look at them in her office during select times but we weren't allowed to take them out of her office. Additionally, the way the homework is graded is so stupid. On the syllabus it said that they will only grade two problems for correctness and the rest for completion, however this was basically a complete lie as a lot of students got points off for the completion problems that they had done incorrectly. Also, Kamat's office hours are Friday at 3 pm which is such a bad time because no one has started the homework by then and a lot of people have class at 3, and then the TA office hours are Friday at 3 and Monday at 2, which are also very inconvenient times.
I liked the professor and her teaching style because it was very organized and direct. Her tests were not impossible, although it was a time crunch.
This class is affectively a filler course for the university. There is nothing novel to the class that is learned here. It draws on the conservation of momentum and force learned in EA2, fluid dynamics via the bernouli equation which I assume we will learn in fluid dynamics the class and conservation of charge covered in Physics 135-2. It would be nice to have one more elective instead of thermodynamics which only deals with heat during weeks 6-9. Stay on top of work and it will be fine.
Overall this course is not too bad. During class you get all of your notes and you must apply during the homeworks. The homeworks take time depending on the week. The problems are harder than tests and exams and they count for a good portion of your grade. It is important to understand these well because although easier, the tests are a time crunch and you have to understand the material well enough to do it fast and right the first time around. However, overall, the material is not hard to understand and apply.
The course is more on the theory side so the problem sets are not too difficult. Prof. Kamat is a really nice professoe who does a great job in explaining everything in detail
The homework is lengthy, make sue you start with time, work with other students, and attend discussion.
Homework takes a while, so be sure to get started early. Exams are a bit of a time-crunch. Prof. Kamat doesn't post notes online, so you have to go to class (or get notes from someone else).
This course was not especially intellectually challenging, but it does require some good problem-solving skills. The weekly homework assignments prevent you from falling behind in the class which is good.
Attend class because the professor doesn't post the notes online. The class also focused a lot on memorizing the equations and plugging numbers into equations. Some of the homework problems were very tedious because there were lots of variables and calculations.
The course was okay. A lot of what we learned in each class was retaught the next class, so the content often felt very dragged out and unnecessary.
This class was very poorly structured because aside from the problem sets, which were extremely long and beyond what we went over in class (one time taking me almost 20 hours to complete), there was no other additional practice to review for exams and go over course material, which is the main way I am able to study and feel prepared. Hopefully in the future students will have more access to extra practice problems made by the professor or solutions to book problems.
Exams were long but generally fair, homework was decently time consuming but helpful, Professor Kamat is good teacher and she teaches in a very light-hearted manner which I appreciated
Dr. Kamat was always very relatable and easy to learn from. However, sometimes the homework took way too long. They aren't typically difficult problems; but with the engineering methodology that we have to follow (which I do like, since it makes sense in terms of the progression of the problem), the problems often take extended periods of time to complete. Also, I often found myself making up methods to solving problems, since they were often different from problems we look at in class, so it was often frustrating to not know what I was doing until I compared my answers to the key after the homework was due. This is especially important because the homework problems are more similar to what is on the exams in comparison to the problems done in class.
Professor Kamat really cares about her students and does a good job of making the material easy to understand. Course starts off very easy but ramps up later. The problem sets are very long and difficult (so start them early and go to discussion) but the tests are very manageable.
The course was interesting and well taught but the homeworks took upwards of 6-8 hours some weeks. The TAs are good about answering questions in discussion though, which was useful. The first and second midterm were not too difficult but I felt really pressed for time, while the final was better paced but a lot harder.
Kinda weird course. Not a ton of material is covered, but the problem sets were absurdly long and tedious. Exams were alright if you manage your time.
Took this as a basic engineering requirement for IE major; was happy to see that everything is very math-based and looks like algebra⿊lculus word problems. The HWs were pretty long, but not hard for the most part since lectures were very clear and easy to follow.

Comments
This is one of my favorite courses I have taken at Northwestern. I thought the lectures were both interesting and helpful and I was particularly interested in the material because I think it is extremely applicable to real-life engineering.
Very reasonable class. Many applicable concepts and Alarcon is an amazing teacher who is very passionate and cares about her students. The more examples problems you do the more you will get out of the class. If you put in the effort she will do her best to help you succeed.
Arancha is a fantastic professor. Only take this class with her. I struggled in EA2, so I thought I was going to struggle in this class - that was not the case! She helped clarify everything and truly cares about her students success. She gives you all the tools to do well, you just have to use them.
The instruction for the course was extremely helpful, every class lecture, video posted, and FAQs all helped lead to a better understanding of what was happening. At times the homework were extremely time confusing but always assigned far in advance.
If you have the chance to take CivE216 with Professor Alarcon, please do. She is absolutely one of the kindest and most capable professors I've ever had. She takes the time to get to know each student's name, goes out of her way to explain concepts in multiple ways so that students who learn differently can succeed equally well, and is just a really talented, effective teacher. Her passion for the topic makes it much more interesting to learn as well. The midterms were challenging but overall, fair. Make sure to do extra problems and to take advantage of office hours. Overall, this class was a great experience, especially due to Professor Alarcon.
Prpfessor Alarcon was absolutely fantastic and provided so any different ways to learn the material, whether posting her own written, thurough hw solutions online, her remarkable videos, or just houng over the problems in class through multiple different ways.
Arancha is the best!!!! Take it with Alarcon she actually cares about her students and makes an effort to get to know them! Go to her office hours she's amazing!!!
This class is very interesting and necessary towards BME. The homeworks were great practice and lectures were very thorough.
The professor was very approachable, clear, organized, and extremely helpful. I found the material interesting and very applicable to my major. The class style was great as we did lots of practice problems in class but also went over concepts even when online lectures were posted regarding those topics. The pace of the course was very manageable but I still felt that I learned a lot.
I loved Dr. Alarcon's way of teaching and learned alot in this class. While the material may seem unimportant with how computers are used to run all of the calculations, Knowing how the equations work is super useful. I suggest anyone who is an MechE to take this class especially with Dr. Alarcon. If I could I would take this class again.
It is a required course for my major, which means it helps me to advance my skill. So in that sense it is necessary to master relevant problem solving skills
This course was critical to developing an approach to structural loading and failure analysis that I was using directly in Mech 240 during the same quarter. We moved quickly enough that I didn't struggle at all to apply what I was learning directly to my other subject and I actually believe it helped me reinforce the material by taking both simultaneously.
Very good teacher, material is tough but definitely doable. Online resources provided by professor are great. Take it with her.
I really thought Ms. Alarcon was a motivating, friendly and helpful teacher. She gladly anwered any questions in class and encouraged everybody to speak their mind to further understand what was being taught in class. Most importantly, her enthusiasm for her field of work could not go unnoticed. The class was pretty forward. If you get a hang of the logic this course will be easy yet insightful.
Alarcon is a pretty good teacher and cares a lot. She gives you all the tools to do well so just check Canvas and go to her office hours. Iɽ say go to class for her thorough explanations especially for new topics. We learn a lot of material in this course but overall it's not too demanding.
Very good class that is taught very well. Even if you only have a passing interest in the field, it is a very good class to take for basic engineering requirements. One thing to note is that the exams tend to be very rushed.
This class is as advertised. The first half of the quarter is easy, and then the difficulty picks up pretty quickly into the end of the quarter. The midterms are pretty long, so you have to work fast if you want to finish.
Prof. Alarcon is really passionate and inspiring. I am not a CivE (IEMS) and I adimt that I felt constantly excited about learning the material even thought it has nothing to do with my major. Prof. Alarcon, is very attentive and tries a variety of different approaches to have students learn the material. She would have students come to the board and try practice problems, was readily available for OH, and NEVER disregarded a question --she was always excited to clear any doubts.
Prof. Alarcon is a great lecturer - she explains concepts very well, comes up with a vast amount of resources to help students with understand both the knowledge of the subject and knowledge of completing exams/homework, and cares for her students.
This class would be awful without Alarcon. I hated EA2 and thought it was a real pain. But Alarcon made this class super easy and even relatively interesting. Definitely would take again. I don't recommend the BME section though.
This is a wonderful class. I know it is a requirement for many, but let yourself enjoy it. The homework and the exams are incredibly fair. If you go to class and listen and work through the problems with Professor Alarcon, you will do well. The class is organized and she equips you with everything you need to succeed and learn a lot. One of the first classes where you feel that what you're learning is applicable to the real world. Love this class.
Great class and not too difficult. Great teaching style and tools
Alarcon is a good lecturer. Not a hard class if you go to lecture. I was able to complete the homework very quickly each week but it was a little annoying to have to use the yellow engineering paper. Labs are easy, but the write up can take a few hours as a group.
Professor Alarcon is organized and gives many resources including videos, solutions, and supplemental information. She has a good teaching style, is always excited about the class, and genuinely wants every student to do well.
Interesting to learn a little more about architecture and civil engineering in general, though I can't imagine myself doing it as a career
Take it with Alacron. Enough said.
I can't imagine taking this class with anyone other than Alarcon. She makes it so easy to do well, and if you follow her advice and do the problems when you should, you'll do well in this class.
Alarcon is an especially dedicated and helpful professor. She really wants you to learn. It's a lot of work, but if you put in the time you can keep up. Do practice problems and you'll probably be fine.
V good idea to take this course with Alarcon. She explains topics very clearly and tells you exactly what you need to know. Exams are pretty straightforward and are similar to the practice exams.
The curriculum is very straight forward and easy to follow.
This course covers material that is integral to basic engineering, especially skills that will be the foundation for other classes.
Alacron is very systematic which can be a drag sometimes, but follow her process and you will do well.
Class was exactly as a expected to be.
Not a big fan of the material but the professor was very helpful and put so many resources out there for you to learn
This course was good. The labs were not that difficult and the homework was a good representation of the exams.
Teacher was really helpful.
Great course. Very interesting. Not a lot of required busy work like in a lot of classes, so you really get what you put into the course.
I think this class is a perfect follow-up to EA2. Having taken the two sequentially made for a very natural transition. Of course, the topics are more advanced than those of EA2, but it never felt overwhelming. Overall, I enjoyed learning about mechanics of materials much more than I would have expected.
This course emphasized large number crunching methods that was good practice for engineering but proved to be difficult to understand and impossible to apply in my other classes.
Take this class with Alarcon -- she's the best. Do the practice and homework at least mostly by yourself and it shouldn't be too hard of a class.
I actually had fun with the material in this course and enjoyed solving the problems. I remember struggling with the subject in the engineering analysis course and finding it rather boring but Professor Alarcon was so passionate about the topic that it was hard not to be interested in it with her. She made the lectures very clear and organized, which I really appreciated. She clearly cares about her students and go way beyond her way to help each and every student that she can in any way.
Professor Alarcon is an amazing professor who truly cares about her students and is passionate about what she teaches. She's incredibly talented at teaching and makes this course a breeze.
The lecture was extremely helpful because we went through examples in class. The professor took time to explain and also had examples to help enforce the concepts we learned.
Good class. Great teacher. Very helpful, especially if you ask for it. Exams kind of long, not unfair though. Overall ok.
I love how much passion Prof Alarcon puts into this class and her students. I can tell that she really cares sincerely about both the material and our learning. I think she is a great professor and I appreciate her teaching style, organization, and jokes.
This is a course with somewhat challenging criteria but a great professor. If you go to class and be present and attentive, you should do well in the course. Make sure that you do as many practice problems as you can, as they are a very good representation of what will be on the exams.
It was fine, not incredibly interesting but probably helpful when we begin designing structures.
Alarcon is an amazing teacher who actually cares about how her students are learning. If you're going to take this course, try to take it with her! Also, this class is all about the amount of work you put in. It's not hard to do well if you just spend time practicing all the problem.
I really enjoyed Professor Alarcon's method of teaching. You could really tell that she cared about her students. I never went into office hours, but I'm sure she would be very helpful. If you don't understand a method she's teaching, I think it's easy to ask her for another way to think about it. I didn't really like the separate class for BME students. I wish it was integrated into our daily lectures. I don't think non-BME students would be upset if Profesor Alarcon used a bone structure to show an example. I think it would make the lectures more interesting.
This course was easy for those looking for a distribution requirement. The homework and labs are straightforward, and the midterms aren't bad either.
Flexible grading schema makes it so no one has to drop the class after a midterm or a bad assignment. Grading schema can include using your final as 70% of your grade. BEWARE THOUGH- the final is hard!!
Alarcon is good if you care about the class. Come to class for extra credit. Midterms are decent, final TBD.
Alarcon is very passionate, which makes her a good professor... But i thought the midterms were absurdly long and not always the most consistent with the material we learned
The course was helpful in applying equilibrium physics to deformations.
Being an IE major first thought I would really dislike this class. It turns out I sort of liked it. It was really nice to take a freshman/sophomore when knowing others in the class. If one is IE major it sort of what you make of it: if you try to like it and work hard then the class isn't bad. Alarcon was the best and really helpful. I wouldn't want to take it with anyone else. Go to lecture! It is 100% a toss up to do the lab or the BME section. The BME lecture and the labs are the worst part of the class.
UNDERSTAND BASICS ABOUT MATERIALS REACTION TO LOADING
This was one of my best experiences in a McCormick classroom. The professor made a real effort to understand the needs of the students and tailor lectures to those needs. She laid out the course in an extremely organized fashion and stuck to the schedule. The problem sets were reasonable and assisted the learning process.
It's a good class, and Prof. Alarcon really does care about students. It's not a bad choice to take after EA2, since a lot of the concepts build on statics.

Comments
This class stimulated interest in the area because of how it incorporated real world problems. It made you want to learn what was happening to better prepare yourself for future problems.
This is a tough course, but well structured. If you listen to her advice, do the problems in the book, actually do the homework, you will succeed. Similar to math courses, if you put in the work you will succeed, but will miserably fail if you half ass it.
I really enjoyed this course! I think the material that was covered is very applicable to real life, and Alarcon does well in relating what we are learning to real life examples. I think that her tests are very fair, and you know exactly what she will cover. So as long as you do practice problems before exams and review your notes, you are bound to do well. She is very picky about her homework, so make sure to follow the guidelines exactly before submitting them. Overall I really enjoyed the course and would recommend it for anybody needing a basic engineering course.
Professor Alarcon is the best! She really cares about her students and gives you every opportunity to succeed in the class, including lots of extra credit. Go to class and office hours and you should be just fine. The BME discussion is far worse; I don't feel like I learned anything from that part of the class, but the amount of work isn't excessive so that should be fine too.
Prof.Alarcon is a great teacher. Kind, helpful and it is obvious that she thought about the course and cares deeply about it. I would recommend taking this course.
I mostly enjoyed the material, and found that the problems still required a lot of thinking and problem solving even though the class centers around only a few formulas.
Pretty good class. Homework’s can be long and labs seem kind of pointless, but the problems are somewhat interesting and Prof Alarcon is really great.
Had to take this as a distro for basic engineering. I should have taken it earlier (a quarter or two after taking EA2). Had to play a little catch-up, but not a bad course. Grading system wants you to do well, as does the Professor. Problem sets are time consuming, not that helpful for learning the material in my opinion.
Alarcon was an incredible lecturer and really cares for her students. She has a lot of resources to help students learn and reading the textbook is helpful as well. The midterms + final are organized well and are not too bad. There is also a lenient grading system so that you can have your final count for most of your grade if you mess up on a midterm. The BME discussion section for this class was organized pretty poorly however. I feel like the BME section is pretty useless in addition and seems like it only brings down your grade if anything. Some topics in the discussion are interesting, but do not match up well with what we are learning in lecture and are not in depth enough to actually learn anything substantive.
do the hw and youll be fine
The course is taught very well and if you listen in class, you will do well. As far as actual content, however, it is very civil-focused, and so seems not very applicable from a BME standpoint.
Really enjoyed this class, Professor Alarcon is amazing and very very helpful. Make sure to go to lecture and sitting up front helps with focusing since it’s quite a large class.
Arancha is a great teacher, she really cares that her students do well and if you go to class you will learn and she will tell you exactly what is on exams which are very fair. The material itself is difficult so expect to put in some time studying and doing the homework. However, the labs are a useless but easy one hour.
I was able to learn more about the material and challenge myself on the material
I thought this course was really well taught. It was definitely challenging but nothing that was too difficult.
This class builds on EA-2, and I would recommend it highly for Basic Engineering. Alarcon posts a lot of opportunities for practice problems, videos and practice exams. She wants her students to do well and really cares. She is far and away the best professor in McCormick. Show up to class and take notes, do the practice exams, sit in the front of class and this class will be very manageable. I wish I could take a class with her every quarter!
The course was very organized which was nice. I always knew what we were doing, why, and how it related to the other material in the course. As a Civil Engineering major it also felt directly related to my future work. Professor Alarcon is great - she's a good teacher and genuinely cares about whether you learn the material. The material is definitely challenging and you need to spend a long time doing homeworks and studying, but if you put in the time it's not too hard to actually learn the material.
I taught myself most the material for this class. I attended every lecture but didn't really get a ton out of them as things were not explained well. The only lectures that were worth while were the ones that were the day before the test. She did a really good job of reviewing all the material. Tests were fair and not too difficult, similar to homeworks but easier. Homeworks were decently long but helped with tests. All in all it was an average class.
Prof. Alarcon-Flemming is a wonderful professor who gives her all to make sure you understand what's going on. Only drawback I personally saw was that she tends to diatance herself from being accesible by providing a sht ton of supplementary examples and documents. If you're like me and have a busy schedule and dont necessarily have. The time to come through several quarters worth of information for clarifications, I strongly recommend prioritizing her and the TA office hours!
This course was similar to EA2. I enjoyed the way that it was taught and that there were so many resources that could be accessed if you are ever confused. If you can take this course with professor Alarcon you should she is amazing.
The civil engineering part of the class was quite fair and the professor provided a lot of material to study from. Perhaps the lecture notes could be a bit clearer to follow, but otherwise it was fair. The BME part of the class was a bit lacking, but I still learned some interesting things from it.
This course was fairly easy especially because Alarcon is a good teacher. Doing all of the homeworks and practice midterms was normally enough to do very well. concepts are not too difficult overall, it's more about being able to do things quickly on the tests. The labs are absolutely pointless, you spend about an hour just breaking or bending or twisting samples and then write the lab report. An easy boost for your grade but I felt like I got nothing out of them personally.
This course is good because you can keep up with the work, it's well organized, and the professor really wants you to learn.
Alarcon is a great professor. She explains things very clearly and it's fairly easy to do well in the class. The weekly homeworks are pretty time consuming but doable. The exams are very fair. It is so worth it to look at the solutions for all old exams posted on Canvas. I really enjoyed the fun fact Fridays.
feel like it could use restructuring, more relevant problems, less focus on doing things only one way and more openness to different approaches.
Excellent course, but challenging. You have to work at it.
It was a good course to supplement other courses that I'm taking. Some of the material can be a little dry but with the right professor you learn a lot .
The instructor really tried to make it interesting for everybody.
It's not too bad, labs are dumb but easy. Do your HW, you'll be fine.
I loved this class! Absolutely take it with Professor Alarcon because she is so passionate about civ e and knows so much! She is super accommodating and willing to help. Also, she takes the time to get to know her students which is refreshing when most engineering professors are just there to teach the material. This course is challenging but if you put in the time and do all the practice problems, an A is obtainable.
This course was great! I'm maybe biased as this is the material that I want to work with for the rest of my life, but Professor Alarcon is genuinely incredible. She teaches the material so thoroughly and energetically. Going to class is definitely key and will make prepping for exams infinitely better. Honestly, she teaches so well that I found myself leaving class with an excellent grasp on the material and simply needed to do practice problems before each exam to increase my speed and full understanding. I would definitely recommend this class and definitely take it with Professor Alarcon.
Prof. Alarcon was a very good lecturer, and made herself endlessly available for any sort of extra help. We did a lot of review (almost every day), which did get a little old but it probably helped a lot. Homeworks are excellent tools to learn the concepts, and without them I wouldn't have done near as well in the course.
This class was really enjoyable. It taught material in a way that introduces why structures around you are built the way they are.
The course was thorough and it contained a lot of information relating to civil engineering.
If you're taking this course it is probably because you have to. It's applications can actually be interesting and Prof. Alarcon is fantastic. The labs are pretty dumb and not that helpful, but manageable.
I think that this course was extremely well taught by Professor Alarcon. The material covered is extremely applicable to engineering in general, and she makes sure to give plenty of real life applications as well as plenty of sample problems so that students are able to master keu concepts.
Learned most of the material on my own doing the homework.
I found this class relatively interesting going in and I liked the course as a whole. I found it very important to follow along in class and go to office hours and look at the extra examples given on canvas. Tests were fair, homework took some time every week, and doing practice problems was the most helpful in the class.
This course was intellectually challenging, but also interesting. I think it is beneficial to have a background in general physics, like EA2, but that it's not imperative.
I really enjoyed the fact that the professor took time to make videos breaking down the important concepts of the course.
It was really helpful.
As the course progressed, and study habits declined in quality. This course did an exceptional job of making relevant study material EASILY and QUICKLY available as well as thorough and pleasant to follow.
Honestly, I was really dreading this class, but Professor Alarcon made this class pretty enjoyable. If you put in the time to studying and understanding the concepts it's not that bad. There were a few concepts that went way over my head the first few days, but once I sat down to learn them they weren't bad. The class is structured for you to succeed (there are different ways for your grade to be calculated, a bunch of grades that impact your overall grade, and tons of bonus points), so if you try you can do well.
Being a senior in industrial engineering (and given that this was my senior spring quarter), I literally had zero interest in the materials taught in this course. My previous experiences with other basic engineering courses were 'okay' at best as I found them to be boring. But this one was different. The level of energy and passion that Professor Alarcon brings to this course is pretty amazing. She also makes the experience of going to class more enjoyable by occasionally providing us with the real-world examples of civil engineering applications. You can just tell from the way she treats her students that she genuinely wants you to succeed in this class; she is always willing to help so don't be afraid to reach out to her. The labs are not very difficult as they actually relate back to the materials learned during the lectures. There are also plenty of resources on Canvas available for you to do well on the exams. I seriously would have considered a different major (e.g. Civ E or BME, etc) if I had taken this class earlier in my Northwestern career.
I was hoping to apply my knowledge from ea2 to this course and learn about civ e in the real world but did not end up learning much. Class was hard to follow and so boring (not because of Alarcon, but because it has nothing to do with my future work/what I'm studying) so I therefore did not enjoy the class. Not nearly as easy as I thought it would be
Super helpful for Mech E. Doing as many practice problems as possible really helps.
I very much enjoyed this class. I felt that the combination of labs, classes, and quizzes that tested our knowledge of the core principles of the class gave me a deeper understanding of Civil Engineering.
If you are going to take this course, definitely take it with Alarcon. She is incredibly nice and extremely fair. She posts all of her solutions to everything, so you can see how she does problems. Many exam questions are taken straight from previous exams, so it's possible to do very well on tests. The hws are not too bad
Alarcon is amazing!!! She really cares about each and every one of her students doing well in her class and gives the class more than enough materials to succeed. She doesn't hesitate to go back and explain a confusing concept again but also holds her class to high standards and expects you to put in work outside of class. She knows the material extremely well and explains it clearly and concisely.
The 4 days a week part that is taught by Alarcon is fantastic, she is great and you will do fine if you just go to class. The once a week BME 271 part taught by Gloria Kim needs to be updated. We had quizzes over things that were sometimes taught later in the class that we did not know, or were just quizzes over things we would never need to know˽id not apply. Kim also doesnt really lecture so much as just read slides to you so fast you dont really pick up anything. Very strange and I hope that this part of the class is changed.
It was hard the first time and it is still hard the second time but I think I'm going to pass this time. So that's nice
a bit daunting and overwhelmed with content
Prof. Alarcon is great. The homework can be tough, but it's a great way to learn. The BME recitation started out kinda boring, but once Prof. Kim took our suggestions into consideration, they got better.
I loved this class. I am terrible about teaching myself from a textbook but did not need to use it one bit as prof Alarcon's lectures are crystal clear and her exams are fair. I considered taking more CIVE classes because of this class.
Great class with a really fast pace and lots of problem-solving.
Great course, this is how engineering courses should be structured. Chapters are formatted very nicely so that each is related and built on previously learned concepts. Professor Alarcon is great, you can really see her passion through her teaching. She provides so many resources and practice problems on Canvas that makes it straightforward and easy to review for tests.
Classes and the playlists are extremely useful- take the time to be there and pay attention, and it will pay off well on the homeworks and quizzes.
I love how Prof Alacron is so patient and so willing to help us learn!! She is an excellent teacher!
Really not too bad. Important that you stay on top of everything. Easy to follow but since it meets everyday, we covered a lot of topics and playing catchup was no fun. Homework wasn't too bad. Make sure you follow her exact formatting or she will give you a zero.

Comments
The material isn't difficult, but digital signal processing is much more of a maths topic than an engineering one or even a modeling one, so at times it felt like what I was expecting of the course and what the course was aiming to be were at odds with the material we were actually supposed to be covering. The lectures really need to be more in the format of a maths lecture, and if possible, reformated with a strong sense for what needs to be emphasized for students to understand the mathematical mechanism behind their calculations, or else what is not an inherently difficult topic becomes almost completely impossible to understand to the fullest. I felt lost for a good portion of this quarter, and I read the textbook multiple times, did the problems we were assigned and then some, and continually didn't feel like my grasp of the material was strong enough to constitute mastery or preparedness for an exam. Professor MacIver put a lot of effort into making the course amenable to students, but I think just in how discursive the lectures were and how long they took to convey information and how math-heavy the class is for what was taught from a mostly application-based perspective, a lot of his efforts fell short.
MacIver's lecture style made it impossible to learn the material in this class. I think if he vastly improved his lecture style, this course would be about fifty times easier and fifty times less frustrating. Also, the labs are way too long and repetitive.
MacIver was new to teaching and SO super cool and nice, but he really had trouble with calibrating the pace and the rigor of the class. The first exam was okay, the makeup exam was crazy difficult, and the final was super reasonable. I had a lot of trouble knowing what was going to be tested, and the syllabus was completely wrong.
This class could have been good if it were taught in a different manner. The labs were tedious and covered topics that we hadn't covered in class yet, so it was difficult to get much out of them. No solutions were ever given to homework problems so it was impossible to do practice problems in preparation for tests. It theoretically should have been a really easy class, but there number of resources to learn from was lacking, with the only helpful ones being the textbook and peer mentor.
This class was not taught very well at all, the textbook and resources given were not sufficient to help us learn the topics. It was mostly self-taught, and you have to go to office hours if you want to do well. Overall, the material was not super difficult, but learning it was not easy.
The actual material is not that hard; however, trying to figure out what you need to know is a struggle.
This course needs to be remodeled. Most of the important concepts were taught very quickly or not at all. We were completely unprepared for the homeworks and labs. The professor and TA were not too helpful. Exams were fair as long as you can teach yourself the material.
He’s a nice person and he seemed to care how we did and that we learned, but he didn’t really know how to make that happen. The class was so unorganized and unclear. Homeworks were always due different days and some weeks not others, labs were inconsistent I never knew if the upcoming weekend I was going to have to devote 10+ hours on a saturday to finishing a lab or not (yes, that happened, it's crazy). Quizzes on Monday would include stuff we literally learned the morning of and barely had time to actually learn and cram before the quiz. Studying didn’t align with a good score because it was really arbitrary what we would be quizzed on. 
Lectures…he spent a lot of time writing sentences and words, a lot of which was word for word reiterated from the textbook. And if he did examples they were often the same ones from the book. So the book did not supplement lecture and lecture did not supplement the book unfortunately. It would have been so helpful to actually do different examples in class so I could actually learn the concepts later on on my own. And speaking of examples, I wish he didn’t just keep them general but instead used examples of a problem we may be given on homework or a test, instead of just the general formula definition with variables. What we learned in class did not prepare us for what kinds of problems we were faced with figuring out on the homeworks, let alone tests and quizzes. I used google and you tube videos to learn so much of what I ended up knowing how to do. We were given labs on things we didn’t learn until 2-3 weeks later so they took a ridiculously unneccesary amount of time and kind of made no sense or i didn't have the background to understand what I was doing with matlab. Towards the end of the class we were all of a sudden expected to do a bunch of proofs for some reason which is not at all what the class was up until then. He spent a lot of time trying to convince us that signals were important, which is fine and great and I get that, but teach me how to actually do the math. And I don’t learn by “playing with signals” on matlab, I learn by doing concrete examples with numbers on paper, especially since that is what we are expected to do on a test. The content itself is not hard, but it was presented not in a clear step by step way so it seemed really confusing, and steps were often skipped and math steps not written out or explained, and I didn’t have enough examples to compare to see how to apply a concept to different problems. We never are able to see solutions to any of the problems we do in homework that we get wrong (it’s just marked wrong) or any of the other practice problems in the book. So we can’t learn from our mistakes, and also I really understand problems by seeing examples of how they are supposed to be done and then I make sense of it. And we’ve had basically none of that. The class was just made a lot harder, more complicated, and with more stress and anxiety and time than I think it needed to be or should have been. And what I put into it didn't translate to what I got out of it so I felt pretty defeated by the end. Hoping this will change for next year though so maybe it'll be better.
This course has easily been my least favorite class that I have taken here at NU. The lectures were extremely unorganized, half of the in class examples had mistakes in them, the tests and homeworks were unnecessarily difficult, and solutions to these were not distributed, so they was no way of knowing why you did something wrong/how to fix it. Office hours were basically required to be successful in this class, so if they didn't fit in with your schedule, you were pretty much screwed.
This class material was okay and not too hard but the way it was presented made it much more difficult than it needed to be. It almost moved too slow also.
It felt like the professor was just reiterating the book. I'm not convinced he understood the content fully. Much of the class did not attend his lectures because of this. In addition, we didn't even go through one of the big 3 concepts that were supposed to be covered in this class.
This class was a mess. The stuff we learned in the first two weeks seems completely irrelevant to the actual course objectives, we would have to complete (Matlab) labs on topics we had yet to learn in class, we weren't given the solutions to any homework problems so we didn't know what we did wrong, some of the "quizzes" were way too long, the prof didn't seem to have a great grasp of the material (at least not well enough to communicate these concepts to students who have never heard of these things before), etc. Honestly the material doesn't even seem to be that hard but the way in which it is presented makes it really hard to learn it. Hopefully this class will be structured better next year.
This was rough. The professor made this course 100 times harder than it needed to be. The lectures were characterized by the professor writing on his Microsoft Surface almost illegibly with too many words and nowhere near enough examples. He was unable to go through an example problem and explain why he was taking the steps he took. A very poor experience.
This is a math-heavy course, and it's not harder than ones you've already taken. The professor is OK at explaining things, but not especially good. That plus the fact that homework is taken from the textbook means you do need to rent or buy it. The TA for the class was Urgurcan, who is not good at explaining things and is a very demanding grader.
THIS CLASS WAS AWFUL. I'm truly sorry that you have to take it, and I really hope it gets better for you. The course lacked any organization - couldn't use the syllabus because it wasn't what our professor followed, professor constantly stated that we were falling behind (despite not even learning the material effectively when covering it the first time), and there were no example questions we could work on practicing with because no solutions were posted online. The labs were awful and disconnected from the course because we had not covered the material prior to completing the labs - and overall this class sucked. Good luck.
The teacher did not really know what he was doing. He was a very nice guy who was very excited and motivated and I think that he has the potential to be a good teacher in the future. However, he essentially wrote out full sentences from the text book on the lectures which were just generally not even readable in the first place. He also failed to demonstrate with examples or give us any resources for the course including solutions to any of the problem sets, quizzes, or tests for reference.
Course structure lacking, resulting in confusion and ineffective use of time.
The material itself wasn't that bad, reading the book and going to TA and student peer office hours was really helpful.
This course helped me learn a bit about signals, but not all of the material from the syllabus was covered in lecture. The lectures were difficult to understand.
Wow. What to say about BME 306. Malcolm seems to be a pretty nice guy that keeps rambling on about specifics of a subject of which almost literally no one understands the basics. He clearly has never spoken to Hao Zhang (the instructor of BME 305) about what we did or learned in that class and therefore expects us to have random knowledge that we don't have and continues speaking about things we've already done. Add to all of this the fact that the class is in complete disarray, with not even the syllabus getting an update from year to year.

Comments
This was a confusing course because you never really knew what you were doing and how it related to things in real life. It was kind of unorganized- not the professor but the actual material of the class.
From what I hear, this course has been terrible in the past. Professor Gentry tried genuinely to make it better, and succeeded in a lot of ways. The exams were fair, but challenging, the problem sets were as short as they could be while still covering all the material we were supposed to learn, and overall the class was taught well. A couple gripes with prof Gentry were that the exams were handwritten so sometimes reading them was tough, and his scanner didn't show pencil well so if heɽ post handwritten notes online theyɽ be illegible. Other than that, Gentry is a great professor who made this class accessible and (sometimes) fun. Labs were also not awful - having a real-life goal in labs makes them a lot more palatable, especially compared to EA4 labs.
Good course, you'll learn a lot especially with regard to Fourier transforms and signal analysis. Professor Gentry is great and extremely fair and understanding. Course greatly exceeded my expectations.
I learned a lot in BME 306. The textbook was very very difficult to follow because it was not clear and sometimes assumed the reader knew more than you would expect him or her to. The lectures were helpful only if the textbook was read in advance because most of the teaching is directed using examples instead of theory explanations.
Good class, but Prof. gentry isn't great at explaining content and brushes by a lot of topics.
I didn't find the material to be that hard, but the textbook is terrible and essentially can't be relied on to supplement the lectures very well. I had heard not so great things about Gentry coming into this class, but I actually thought he was a pretty good teacher.
Labs are super annoying but the hw is usually not terrible. Prof Gentry is mostly okay. Sometimes a little scatter-brained but overall not much worse than 305
I didn't know what to expect coming into this course and I honestly just feel average coming out of it. The material wasnt interesting, the textbook also was poor guidance in terms of the information and our professor did pretty much the best he good given the circumstances.
Often confusing what we were learning about.
Gentry is a great guy. If you keep up with the work and actively participate in the labs you should find this class isn't too hard.
It was a difficult course that was rather intense on the time commitment, usually needlessly so. Homework often could have been done more quickly if concepts were taught with greater detail (sometimes the concepts were introduced the day the assignment was due, which was irritating) — if they keep the Tervo book, nearly half of it is wrong as Prof. Gentry points out, so the fact that there's so much pushback from the BME dept. to fix what is a perennially train wreck of a sequence is pretty disheartening. Labs are irrelevant outright, and the grading criteria is so unclear they might as well not have one (the TA grading the labs had approved of our outputs in the lab period when asked and then docked us mercilessly for the same items, most likely because she did not really understand the task/grading criteria herself). Overall, it was a frustrating experience, but Prof. Gentry is a nice guy — it's a shame that it was under this context that I met him since he's leaving me with such a bitter taste in my mouth.
The labs are annoying because you get a new random group every week, but they build on each other so the new groups have to spend time consolidating code because everyone uses different variable names. It's a pretty manageable class. The TA was great and really helpful and willing to work with you. Gentry is good, but if you don't immediately understand he's not great at being able to explain it but he'll try really hard.
This course was mostly a math class. Professor Gentry openly told us "you probably aren't going to use this information after the final." Exams were fair.
It's hard to be motivated in a class when the professor starts the first lecture with "You're probably never going to use this in real life".
This course was better than what Iɽ expected after reading the CTECs from previous years. We had useful examples in class and homework, and the exams were quite straightforward based on practice provided by Prof. Gentry. The class is structured where you do have to get a 94% to earn an A, with only individual assignments (read: midterm) being curved. Therefore, you have to constantly deliver if you want to score high.
Can be a bit hard and labs were confusing as we didn’t know how we’d be graded, but Gentry was open to help and the assignments and exams are to the point
this isn't that hard of a class, but Gentry is not a great teacher and the textbook sucks.
Gentry tried. This course is not actually that bad, but the teaching methods were bad. It was his first year, so I don't really blame him. Make sure to over-prepare for exams because the midterm definitely hit us harder than we expected. Lectures are boring, but sometimes the textbook is wrong so I guess it's necessary to go. Labs are annoying but definitely not as bad as 305 labs because they're all MATLAB; lab groups are randomized each week though so good luck.
Math heavy course, the application to bme was a little loose, but tests were fair so success wasn't unattainable.
Too much math but Gentry was really cool.
Gentry teaching this is definitely a positive. He stripped down the material to what you need to know pretty well, exams are fairly straight forward too. Lectures could be a bit dry, but I think he does an adequate job of presenting material that a lot of people may not find fascinating. The book is horrible however, lots of errors, homework is extremely ambiguous. Office hours are fairly imperative to understanding what you're supposed to do to complete the assignments. Overall not the worst class I've taken in BME
Very good and interesting class, but a lot of examples in bith lecture and the text books are just wrong (mess up algebra, drop a constant, etc.). As long as you keep track of these issues and bring them up in class to have them corrected, course makes sense, bur can also cause a lot of confusion if not corrected.
Lecture is confusing, it feels both necessary and like a waste of time all at once. Lab was actually interesting and manageable, and really seemed like the only useful part of the course. Gentry moved quickly through material and often did not explain why we would do something unless someone specifically asked "why". Homework was difficult to complete and the textbook is pretty much useless and riddled with errors. Often times, the TA would have incorrect solutions which made it hard for them to provide usefull help.
I think Gentry is really good at explaining the conceptual parts of this class, but when it comes to the math and more exact methods not so much. I think he might be too chill for that. I feel like somethings were assumed to be easy to understand, but they weren't. Also, the labs in the class were frustrating. Not because of the content but mostly because of the structure of them. They built off each other and we changed groups every week. I don't think it works to have both. One or the other.
BME 306 is quite the class. The book used for this class is absolutely no help. There are not enough examples, and there are not even odd answers in the back so you can do other practice problems. The information is not always clear when being taught. Doing the homework takes far too long for only a couple of problems as a result. This might have been solved with a better book. Additionally, the labs start out fine and progressively end up getting more and more unclear as to what exactly is wanted. Also, switching lab groups every week was not helpful, because the stuff needed for lab carried over every week so it was hard having three people with different versions to work from.
Kinda confusing topics but professor gentry and the undergraduate ta are both super helpful if you go to office hours.
Very boring with no context. Took a lot of time especially with a terrible book to self teach the content
Professor Gentry did a good job. The class was fairly manageable, just the problem sets occasionally seemed overly difficult because they did not exactly line up with the lecture material. Also, the textbook itself was fairly confusing and not helpful in trying to learn the material. The tests were fair.
It was alright
The course was particularly challenging for me. The material was very abstract at times and wasn't taught very clearly.
It is a good course. The professor is very caring.

Comments
This was a fun introductory circuits class. The labs sometimes took a while to complete but were rewarding in the end. I learned a lot and have a new found interest in circuits and mechanical engineering. The exams are not super difficult if you study. Overall, one of my favorite classes I've taken at NU.
Great course, homework assignments and labs really help to solidify material taught in class.
The powerpoints were really crowded and we never actually spent time on them fully in class. His writing was messy/hard to follow and i feel like we didnt do a lot of concrete examples. Some of the homeworks were fine, some were much harder. The tests were fine except for a couple difficult parts, but plenty of time for them. The labs could sometimes be really tricky and time consuming and confusing, other times was able to finish during the lab period. But the grading wasnt harsh for them which was nice
The weekly labs and homework were fairly time consuming but overall the material wasn't too bad.
This class was actually a lot of fun. Labs feel a little unguided and above your level at first (because they are) but as the weeks go by it gets a lot easier to pick up the skills that are required for them. Nick is really helpful, so ask for help all the time; this gives him an opportunity to tell you things about the lab (which might be helpful to be in the lab, but any way you can get it, do). Lecture was actually quite enjoyable, and Prof. Zhang is a good instructor. Somehow he manages to avoid a lot of the tedium associated with the "sitting around watching a professor solve problems" style of lecture in a very problem-oriented course. I didn't feel like lecture dragged on or were pointless, and he is very clear about what are the concepts we needed to take away from the class.
The labs can be frustrating sometimes, but Nick is so helpful.
The lectures do a good job at covering the theory, though for problem solving more practice is definitely needed outside of class. The labs were interesting and challenging. Office hours were very important as small errors in the labs could take a very long time to fix.
Great course
Professor Zhang's lectures were helpful and he did many helpful examples, although sometimes they were hard to understand. The lab component is challenging but helpful- you will probably need to go to office hours to complete them. The exams and quizzes were fair, make sure you understand the homeworks.
The labs of the course are very engaging and Nick is very helpful. Overall good course.
The lab portion of this class is pretty great. Nick is a great instructor, although sometimes he's a little too cryptic for my liking. Nick, I'm not asking for help because I want you to do it for me, I'm asking for help because I'm utterly lost and your cryptic answers often do not help at all. Moving on, Hao Zhang, on the other hand, pretty much kills any interest I have in this class. Not only are his slides extremely cluttered and hard to follow, it's just poorly taught. When you combine a weekly homework and labs that you don't finish during the allotted time (because you're totally lost and Nick gives you a non-answer and our TA was obviously instructed to do the same), I find myself spending upwards of 8-11 hours/week on this class OR less than 3. There is no in between, and you never know ahead of time which it'll be.
The labs may take a while, but they give good hands on experience. The class is not too difficult if you pay attention in class and to the examples Prof. Zhang gives. The homework helps with understanding the material.
This class was simultaneously the best and worst class I have ever taken at Northwestern. The class was extremely informative and interesting, as I have never taken a hands on circuits class before, but the workload of the lab portion was absolutely insane.
I actually liked this course more than I thought I would. Hao's teaching takes a little time to adjust to, but I grew to love him throughout the quarter. The labs get really long and challenging as the quarter goes on, so be sure to stay on top of those. I didn't take advantage of the given lab time during class, but I think I would've been much less stressed if I had stayed longer during lab periods. The exams are very straightforward and the labs are graded pretty leniently. Overall, a good course and I learned a ton about circuits without being overly stressed like many other McCormick classes.
I really enjoyed the content of this class. The lab was great and Nick is super helpful. The lecture was a little all over the place but if you focus hard and listen it will make sense. Getting distracted for a short time will make the whole lecture confusing. Class work is a bit much with homework and quiz and labs on Monday. It was frustrating because Prof Huang would not upload the homework until Thursday when we were supposed to have a week to do it.
The lab portion was by far the best thing about this course. The lecture felt like a slightly more in depth re-hash of EA3 and physics 135-2, and I personally felt that most of the same information could be provided through only the lab section with just a few changes. I had never really touched circuits before taking this class, but I learned so much and feel quite confident with circuits now.
The lab was really interesting and somewhat demanding. Prof. Zhang and the TA showed mercy when grading.
I felt that the lectures didn't add that much to the class. I learned from the book and homework assignments. The content isn't particularly hard, and it didn't take that long to learn the concepts. The major portion of this class was the lab, as they proved to be more challenging and time-intensive than other labs I've had at Northwestern.
Sometimes lectures are kind of confusing, but not a bad class overall. Actually super interesting bc I didn't know anything about this topic before this class. Labs can be really frustrating, but Nick is the best!!
Nick the TA has office hours for lab every weekday for two hours and it's extremely helpful, but also sometimes if the lab was particularly hard, it was difficult to get his attention for help. Prof. Zhang was a decent professor, but the slides need so much work, it's hard to follow both in and out of class.

Comments
Course involves lots of work, but if you keep up, you'll do fine. Nick is absolutely great and he's super super helpful.
Hao is a great and funny person! However, his teaching skills progressively declined over the quarter. We ran through Fourier Transforms way too quickly, and he moves incredibly fast. So, it is quite hard to even understand where you are confused, until you get to the homework and realize you have no idea what is going on. As for the labs, Nick Marchuk is a lifesaver. Absolutely fantastic and helpful person. GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS!
slides are messy and have squares and he writes messy on the board and talks soft and is not engaging. doesnt really explain anything. nick is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The problem sets and quizzes are not difficult. You will spend a lot of time on labs-they are a huge pain but will help you learn concepts in class.
I think this course is very challenging, but great at engaging the students. The lecture portion could be improved, a lot of times I was lost on what we were supposed to know and didn't learn it until I did the homeworks. The lab portion was great, I learned a lot.
The lectures are hard to follow. The lab TAs are super helpful during lab.
Such an interesting class. Hao's slides are bad but he rocks!!!!!!
The coding in 305 is relatively simple and allows you to learn about the circuits. Weekly quizzes and homeworks help you keep up with the material. Hao is a really nice guy and is funny, and makes fun of his own slides but STILL WONT CHANGE ALL OF THEM OVER TO BETTER SLIDES AHAHAH. Nick ROCKS and will help you understand everything you're doing, rather than just telling you answers. Nick is also an awesome circuit debugger.
This class is pretty nice, as far as junior year BME classes go, but that's not really saying much. Hao is an alright professor, it can be kinda hard to get exactly the information you want from him sometimes when you ask a question. The lab part of class can be hard, but is super informative and feels very practical, especially in the later labs. Nick is dope, very smart, reasonable and easy to talk to.
This is a pretty good introductory circuits class; however, if you've taken any circuits classes before (ME 233𯌳, GEN_ENG 295, etc.) the lectures will be mostly review and kinda boring. The labs were really fun, and Nick does a good job at hands-on teaching. The last few weeks of the class get a little abstract so definitely pay attention to that. Lecture slides are a joke, so either read the book or look things up online if you're trying to review the lectures.
This course is doable, but you have to do a lot of the work on your own. Homework assignments aren't bad if you read the book for strategies. Labs aren't too bad, since Nick and the TAs are really willing to help out.
This class was overall very good. The labs were really well-run and helped the class learn a lot. The grading scheme was also very reasonable.
Lecture is pretty easy and going to class is not necessary. Quizzes are super easy but the exams were pretty hard. Lab is more challenging especially if you have no experience with building circuits. Nick is super helpful though in office hours.
Hao's lectures can be confusing, but the example problems are very helpful if you ask him to slow down. Definitely look at examples out of the book because that is the only way I knew how to do the homework. Labs are very time-consuming but kind of cool.
Prof. Zhang really cares about his students and the course as a whole and it comes off as such when he lectures, which is refreshing compared to another course taken simultaneously with this one *ahem*. He reads the CTECs and legitimately takes it to heart. I hope he puts this message on the slide for CTECs -- I also want to mention the obligatory "Nick is the man" (but don't fret, Hao is also the man).
The beginning was not hard and went slowly, but the second half went quickly and was harder.
Lab is kind of fun but you have no clue what you're doing. Prof Hao is one of the worst teachers I've had at NU. Nice guy, but cannot explain the material in a way that is different from reading the textbook, except for his explanations are less complete than the book. The final exam was nothing like we expected either.
Pretty good class. Nick is very helpful for lab. Hao is a pretty good lecturer, but the slides suck. Hao acknowledged that they're bad but refuses to remake them.
I enjoyed being able to apply what we learned in class to build circuits during lab. I also enjoyed working on labs specifically designed for biomedical purposes.
This class was pretty much useless and yet somehow it was made difficult. The content was not hard, it's basically a recap of EA3/Physics2 plus a bit more on circuit diagrams and Op-Amps. The difficulty arose in the terrible lecturing style, the poorly written test questions, and a just general lack of structure. Starting with the lectures, the slides are awful and if the fact that the slides are awful is mentioned then the professor will laugh and say "they are not his and are from the book so don't complain about them". He made a point at the beginning of the class that the slides are messy and has gotten many evaluations that cite the uselessness of the slides so I am not sure why he has not taken the time to put together slides that are actually usable. On to the tests, if you don't solve a problem the specific way the prof taught you then you are likely to get a zero for the entire question despite the fact that your method 1) gives the correct answer, 2) is in the book, 3) is buried in the useless slides he insisted on using, and 4) how you did it on the homework where you got full credit, good luck figuring that out. The professor also disappeared during the final and there were no TAs present so good luck if you had questions or were worried about cheating. The labs themselves were pretty straight forward and Nick is really good at helping you get your circuit to work and explain what is going on, which is especially important because lecture is most certainly behind lab because you will spend 2 weeks relearning Kirchoffs Laws for the third time in your NU career and if you took any sort of physics in high school you can probably just skip lecture. In general, if you don't have to take this class don't, there are better circuits classes with more responsible professors at NU.
Overall course was challenging but very easy to succeed and then the final just wrecked me as it did everyone else so just be prepared for a very difficult final that doesn't match the rest of the class's difficulty level.
Hao is cool, Nick is amazing
I enjoyed this class, you learn some cool stuff in the lab. Take advantage of lab time.
Good in class in that it's actually trying to teach you the material instead of just making it hard. Labs get easier after you start to understand the concepts.
Great class! Nick is awesome and Prof Zhang is really nice. A little frustrating at times with poor communication regarding hw and last minute changes, but overall pretty straightforward and definitely teaches you a lot.
Professor Zhang is a great guy who's very approachable and easy to talk to so it was really easy to get help. He obviously puts effort into teaching. The only issue I had was the lack of coordination between labs and lectures. We started using op-amps in lab weeks before we actually learned what they did in lecture.
As far as a mandatory BME class goes, this isnt too bad. The grade is very evenly split between homework, quizzes, labs, and exams. Lecture can feel a bit aimless or pointless at times, but it definitely helps for completing the homework. Hao is a solid professor and actually cares about how the class is being received by the students. Nick (head of the lab portion) is a godsend, makes learning the circuits much easier. Loved the hands on portion of this class.
I did not expect myself to be able to do many of the objectives outlined in the labs, but the course taught me a lot and the TAs were extremely helpful in achieving the goal of the lab. Very well put together class.
Overall a great course. You learn a lot. Not the most organized but you can do well if you read the book and do a lot of practice problems. The circuits portion is great! Nick is great!
I wish I could take this class again, definitely one of my favorite classes at Northwestern so far.
A necessary evil. Thought I was done with MATLAB but I was wrong. This class should be for EECS˼omp_Sci majors but for some reason it's a BME class. Steep learning curve so don't get left in the dust. I'm scared for the rest of the sequence
I enjoyed the class. The labs are super cool and practical.
I enjoyed this course. The lecture material was slightly challenging but not ridiculously difficult. The homework assignments and weekly quizzes were a happy medium between easy and impossible and helped to prepare me for the exams. The lab portion of the course was super cool and it felt like the skills we were learning were really applicable. The labs were a little more challenging than the homework, and they required a good bit of work outside of class. That being said NICK (lab instructor) IS A GOD and he will help you through any obstacles you run into.


TL;DR Nick is the man. Utilize him as much as you can
This class is challenging but what's great about it is the way grading is distributed so that you get out what you put. Because homework and labs are such a high percent of your grade, if you work hard then you'll both learn a lot and do really well in the class. I thought it was super interesting, and that's from someone who had never touched a circuit before.
The lectures were pointless and all learning was done in your own time with the "custom" textbook. The professor marked a whole question wrong on the midterm from the entire class because, despite it being worked out properly via what the textbook stated, it wasnt done the way he wanted.
Fairly easy course if you take the time to go see Marchuk for lab help. "I just want to be home with my Christmas tree" - Friends & I while studying for the final
This class was very interesting and very easy to grasp. No prior knowledge was required and the material is taught essentially from the basics. Although Professor Zhang conveys the general concepts of what he is trying to teach well, his lectures can sometimes get hard to follow because he goes very fast when he does problems on the board. Although his powerpoints are cluttered, he takes examples and shows derivations and solves problems on the board, but they are very hard to follow because he goes through them relatively quickly. If you go to class everyday and follow the lecture though, this class is a sure fire A. He isn't trying to trick you; rather, wants you to understand the concept properly and apply it in slightly altered contexts.

Comments
This class focused strictly on the materials of the textbook, so it did not necessarily vary into what was interesting to the students.
Overall a pretty good class, should definitely spend more time on Fourier Transformations and less on some of the repetitive circuit analysis problems
The lecture part of this class was mostly a breeze since you should already know the basics of circuits from EA and Physics. The midterm was very easy with a high average. The final however was ridiculously hard as the material in the second half of the quarter gets much more difficult. The lab portion of this class is good at teaching how to build circuits, however the labs were very stressful and it was difficult to finish the work during the time. I also feel like the lab instructions were usually unclear which made it even more difficult. Nick was very good at helping out with the labs however.
You're only going to take this class if you're required because you BME. All I can say is it was nice to take it early in the spring and have a smaller class instead of the big lecture in the fall
The labs and the homeworks were quite challenging, but you get to make some really cool circuits in this class. The lecture content was manageable but I got a bit lost towards the end of the course.
I did enjoy this class because it was definitely not necessarily hard. Challenging but manageable to do well.
I think if you have a chance to take 305 in the spring lead sequence like I did, you should. Rivnay is a good prof and really knows what he is talking about and is very helpful. Also, you get a lot more personal help from Nick Marchuk in the lab section, which is like half your grade. Had a good time in this class and learned a lot
This course is taught well, I just hated the subject material. It's interesting if you want to go into bioelectronics, but not applicable to other interests in BME.

Comments
Sahakian is an amazing professor who very clearly knows his material and wants students to be able to understand the material -- one of the best BME classes I have ever taken at McCormick. Definitely take this class if you are interested in medical imaging at all.
Very good introduction to a variety of medical imaging modalities. Sahakian is incredibly knowledgable.
This is my favorite engineering course so far at Northwestern. The textbook, while pricey, was extremely well written and worth the money. The material is fascinating. Professor Sahakian is a great professor who explains challenging concepts well and has fair expectations on homework and exams. 10⼐.
Overall this is a great course, you learn a lot about many different imaging techniques. The professor does a nice job teaching the class and I am very glad that I took the course.
comprehensive, mostly about physical basis and some electrical details; slides sometimes too abstract, most understood by reading the book
Sahakian is one of the nicest professors I've had and genuinely cares a lot. It's an extremely fair course and I think the workload is practical. The exams are basically exactly what you would expect, I have nothing but good things to say about this course.
I was somewhat disappointed in this course. I didn't really get much out of the lectures, and about the only truly enjoyable part of the course was working on my project. Homeworks seemed a bit unfair given that the lectures didn't really cover problem solving.
Very doable class, exams pretty straightforward. Sahakian has a very soothing voice.
we had a great TA which is what helped make the class more clear. Exams were based on lectures and homework. Overall a very straightforward class that lets us research any medical imaging topic we wanted. Definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in medical technology!
Prof. Sahakian was really patient when answering our questions and showed great mercy when grading. The class notes were summarized by Prof. Sahakian and very helpful.
Great class for an introduction into biophotonics. Good for BME's to take to see if they are interested in the subject
The material in the class is extremely interesting, but somewhat poorly organized. The tests are very fair and the homework assignments are not overly challenging.
Course was structured in a way that was very conducive to learning the material, greatly enjoyed the instruction
Hands down one of the best classes I have taken at NU. Sahakian breaks down complex concepts into such simple ways. One of the best teachers I've had. If you don't understand something, he's really patient and tries to explain it to you in several different ways. The tests are fair and the homework prepares you very well. He sometimes doesn't cover everything on the homework but going to office hours once a week will get you through the homeworks.

Comments
Fantastic course, Sahakian is great, do actually start the project early, it's fun, but I didn't and it wasn't a good time.
Very good course with reasonable assignments. Learned a lot about several modalities of medical imaging.
Awesome professor, exams are very fair
Prof. Sahakian is a great and he does really well with teaching the material. The homeworks reflect the lectures and are very helpful when it comes to the exams.
BME325 is a broad overview of imaging. This class has a couple of challenging topics, but overall is not very difficult. The material is very interesting, and Dr. Sahakian is a great guy who makes the material manageable and really cares about how much you learn. He's available, and even willing to take time in class to discuss topics if a few people are having issues. This is a great course to take if you want a course that is not very difficult and are interested in imaging.
It's an interesting course that provides a high-level background into medical imaging. The lectures tended to be somewhat boring, but I learned as much as I had hoped to in the class.
Great course, Sahakian is a very good prof and cares a lot about students
Homework's are fairly straightforward and the solutions are provided after which is nice because the tests (midterm and final) are related to the homework. You can also bring in a sheet of paper to the tests so you don't have to memorize everything It can be hard to pay attention in class and know what's important.
I really loved this class!!!!! Super easy - a paper on your choice of topic, weekly hw, a midterm, and a final. All the exams are based on is the hw - so if you understand that, the class is super easy. Simultaneously, I was able to learn a lot about imaging that I thought was significantly more complicated than I could learn, so that was super great as well. Overall, I loved this class and am so happy that I was able to take it!!!!!!
The course gives an excellent introduction into Medical Imaging and is very well organised.
Midterm and final are very similar to homework. Professor explains things clearly.
Dr. Sahakian is very passionate about making sure his students learn. This class is a decent amount of work and reading but is by far the most rewarding of the quarter, Sahakian cares about his students greatly.
Great survey of medical imaging. Alan Sahakian is amazing, very understanding and compassionate. His homeworks actually furthered my understanding of the material instead of being busywork. The paper was not fun to write though.
I came into this course really excited about the material and then realized it wasn't for me. It isn't bad but at this point, I am not interested in the subject matter.
I really liked this class and I definitely learned a lot. It wasn't exactly on what I had expected, I thought it would be more about reading medical images than understanding the physics behind medical imaging, but I still enjoyed it. Professor Sahakian is very friendly and you can tell that he wants everyone to learn the material. The exams are fair and the homeworks are manageable. Iɽ recommend taking this for fulfilling BME track electives.
Professor Sahakian is a great professor and made the class very interesting. He is clearly very passionate about the subject, and is very willing to help students! Not too much work, fair midterm.
The professor is very nice and patient.
ALAN SAHAKIAN FOR PROFESSOR OF THE DECADE. this guy rocks. he has all custom note-sheets with excerpts from the textbook and from very highly regarded primary reference sources old and new alike. he explains all the concepts super clearly and makes really good analogies that help bring some of the harder concepts to life. the homework assignments are very applicable to the exams and the exams aren't meant to trip you up. THIS CLASS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW ALL ENGINEERING CLASSES SHOULD BE CONDUCTED. This class is learning-focused and if you're at all interested in medical imaging sign up right now.
This is a great Category A elective for BMEs! The instructor is really nice and teaches well. Homework load is fairly light, but I ended up retaining a lot of the information presented in class because I just found the course really interesting. Exams are pretty easy too. Overall, a really well-taught class that provides a lot of insight into medical imaging technology.

Comments
This was a great course to introduce the fundamentals of tissue engineering. Dr Ameer encourages discussion in class, and the class itself is designed on the principles of self-driven learning. We also get to work on case studies with a partner, and this helps a lot to discuss your ideas˿indings with each other. The project is also great to work, and gives you a sense of how tacking a hypothetical tissue engineering problem is.
I would take this course again. While the lectures were sparse, I appreciated how Professor Ameer gave us skills to independently approach tissue engineering problems and the time to research topics that specifically interested us.
I really enjoyed the discussion sessions and also the final project. These both provided good feedback from the class and instructor.
I liked the discussion setup of the course, but I wish the class syllabus was better structured. There were a lot of changes we had to adapt to. This class was fairly challenging for me, as it is my first tissue engineering related course, but I did like that we were tested on what we researched and analyzed through our writeups, rather than memorizing a bunch of information for exams. I've done well so far though, so I would definitely recommend this class if you're looking to do any form of research in this field now or in the future.
Self paced course. I learned as much as I cared to learn.
Good class for further building on tissue engineering concepts, largely in the form of reading papers and thinking about what people are currently doing in the field. All of the work is partner (hw) or group (project) based.
The case study˽iscussion format of the class is interesting and not overly time consuming in terms of workload. As someone with no prior BME experience, I found the class challenging but very manageable. A lot of learning on your own but not overly stressful. I highly recommend taking this course if you are interested in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.
Since the course is discussion based, it is a lot more interesting than if it was just lecture based. Case studies help you apply theoretical knowledge to actual problems in the field of tissue engineering. Dr. Ameer has a vast knowledge about the subject and encourages the students to participate. Glad I took the course!

Comments
This class is a discussion based class where each student looks up papers for each week's case study to discuss in class. I felt that I would have learned more if there was a short lecture giving background for each case study before we looked at papers.
Dr. Ameer presents a guideline for each week to guide you to follow and you must do a lot of research yourself. If you do not like little guidance, this course may not be for you as you have to dig into the literature and make sure you can take criticism for your ideas.
The discussion and case study format was a strength of this course as it allowed for the application of knowledge and class discussion.
A repeat of biomaterials with less effort put into it.
No exams
Highly discussion based
This class was a lot different than what I would've thought. It was 2 days a week with discussions about preliminary research on Tuesdays and then discussions again on Thursday. I thought he would've lectured at least one of the days so weɽ know what to do for the case study. This would've been very helpful because I came in with no background on Tissue Engineering. It took 3 case studies (out of 6) for my partner and I to get the hang of them. We learned to do like 20 minutes of research for Tuesday's discussion and not start writing until Thursday afternoon (they were due on Fridays) because Ameer would give advice on both Tuesday and Thursday class. The proposal project was okay... my group really didn't pull their weight so my partner and I felt pretty burdened. One less case study would have made the proposal process a lot less stressful.
A discussion based course was intriguing, and the class met expectations for the first few weeks. However, the conversations became very similar week to week, and it was not as interesting as I expected.
Good course if you're interested in the topic or as an elective. The final project is a nice way of applying the knowledge acquired during the quarter while developing a novel idea.
very good class but is a little intimidating as an undergrad.
Case studies were interesting but not necessarily that useful for learning broadly about the topic of tissue engineering. The course was not well structured and a lot of time felt wasted due to that fact.
Interesting class but too many grad students. It’s hard to produce work on their level and the TA doesn’t seem to take your grade level into account.
Somewhat hard to jump into if you don't have a strong tissue engineering background, there aren't really lectures since it's all case studies and discussions based off a weekly prompt so if you don't have a strong background on basic tissue engineering there is a somewhat steep learning curve at the beginning. But Prof. Ameer answers all questions, even basic ones, very thoroughly without judgment and is always helping us to succeed and understand the material instead of just writing a document to turn in. If you are disciplined enough to read a lot of papers and retain the information, this class will be easy. Otherwise, it will be rough for a few weeks, but the case studies and the midterm / final presentations and papers aren't terribly difficult.
