Comments
I loved the course, I learned a ton about the spanish language and culture. I'm still kinda shitty at spanish but it was fun regardless.
Professor Amorese was the best! We reviewed vocab and grammar during class in partner activities which was helpful in solidifying the grammar/vocab we learned from the homework assignments. We did have a quiz almost every week but I preferred that because it gave me a chance to review the information and also have more grades besides just the 2 tests, compositions, and homework.
The course was a good one, in which we tried to focus on speaking the language as the best way to learn it.
I really enjoyed the course and feel prepared to move to the next level.
I didn't expect to learn so much Spanish in such a short period of time, especially when I had never studied the language before. Classes do move very fast and its important to try and keep on top of vocabulary. Profesora Amorese is very enthusiastic and made coming to class enjoyable. However, I do feel that she is a pretty harsh grader compared to what my friends have said about their professors in other 101 classes.
I was not looking forward to taking Spanish, but the class was still somewhat interesting because we didn't purely focus on vocab and grammar. Sometimes the homework assignments felt more like busy work, but most of them helped me be prepared for class and understand the material.
First, this course is very good and I would highly recommend it to a new Spanish student. If you have any Spanish background however, it will probably be all review. Professor Amorese is very passionate about Spanish and is very good at communicating ideas, assigning relevant work, and designing tests that assess acquired skills. Quizes are frequent, but helpful in keeping the whole class at the same level.
It's a lot of learning Spanish outside of class and sometimes it does get very frustrating. But professor Amorese is extremely understanding and is a great teacher with a lot of enthusiasm.
I loved this course!
This was overall a great course. It was very introductory, but that was helpful to me since I had never taken Spanish before. The workload wasn't too much, but it was just enough for me to feel like I was actually learning valuable language skills. If you are at all considering learning Spanish, take this class, and take it with Amorese!
This course required a lot of small assignments outside of class because we spent most of class speaking. We also took several quizzes throughout the quarter. We covered a lot of content in a short amount of time. It was a lot of work, but we really learned a lot. If you can, take this course with Professor Amorese. She is a tough grader, but she is very enthusiastic and made the class more fun!
I really enjoyed this course because it wasn't too challenging, but we learned a lot.
This was a great introductory course for starting out in the Spanish language! Professor Amorese was energetic and very helpful when any material was confusing. As long as you stay on top of the homework and take time to practice the vocabulary and grammar concepts, this class was not too hard.

Comments
I enjoyed this course a lot. Professor Colom-Mena was witty and fun to talk with. He was really good at leading the discussion in class and gave us helpful worksheets that really boosted our knowledge while also giving us cultural information. What I did not like was the Pearson MySpanishLab work, which felt like a waste of time. It was not helpful at all in my mastering of material. Professor Colom-Mena was not a fan of it either, but we had to do it, because the Spanish department makes us. Buying the access code feels like a waste of $150.
The teacher is very knowledgeable of the language, so he taught without the book most of the time, which helped the class learn more.
I adored this course because of the fact that my professor, Joel Colom-Mena, structured the class to be very conversation oriented. I feel as though I am leaving with a comfort with speaking Spanish beyond that of a beginner.
Study regularly.
It was good.
I loved this class. It was great because the professor created an environment that got all students excited about Spanish and made us learn the language rather than reading from a book.
I loved taking this course. If you can take it with Professor Colom please do! He was an amazing instructor.
This was my favorite class of the quarter and the only class that did not fill me with crippling dread and depression when I thought about it. It helps that I am taking Spanish because I want to and not as a language requirement, but this was an incredible experience.

Comments
This was a fantastic course! You learn so much about Spanish history, culture, and contemporary life. The course material was very engaging and thorough, as it's a combination of modules, articles, short videos, and films. The class was very comprehensive. We discussed course material, but also had plentiful conversations and debates comparing Spain to the U.S. Reyes is a fantastic instructor who deeply cares about the subject, and she knows how to engage the class.The best part of the course are the mesas redondas. These are discussions with 4-5 classmates about the films you watch for the course (there are 2). This was a great way to practice speaking skills in a relaxed environment.
You'll learn a lot about Spanish history and present-day issues in the country; be prepared to speak Spanish constantly and not care if you mess up! Reyes is a fun, theatrical and encouraging professor who really wants you to succeed. The class itself is pretty easy; make sure to do the homework or you'll let your classmates down. There's no place to hide if you don't know what you're talking about.
There was a lot of busy-work to do at home, but class was very interesting and engaging.
I liked this class a lot. Didn't focus on the language or grammar of spanish very much but learned a lot of interesting stuff about Spain as a country
It was an excellent style for learning a language. Very engaging and participation based. The class had a surprising amount of homework, more than I expected.

Comments
Really fun course! Not too hard, as the only work is to read the book. Tests weren't too bad, just focus on the passages discussed in class. The professor is really knowledgeable on the book. Class got dry at times since it really is just the professor lecturing for 50 minutes, and attendance is mandatory, but it's not hard at all.
Professor Fernandez-Morera has a lot of knowledge on the content and DQ itself is a very interesting/humorous read. But because the class is highly reading based, it becomes very stressful if you fall behind on readings, which is easy to happen after the first midterm when the readings pick up. I would take this class if you have some time in your schedule. Overall a good class.
This course is a good lesson in time-management! You only need one 1000+ page book for this class. There's a midterm, a final, and weekly discussion sections. We were allowed to take home the essay portion of the final and complete quick quote identification during the exam time. Lecture is fine. It can be a little early for some (10am) and the professor speaks softly, so you might lose focus easily, but other than that, two thumbs up. Don Quixote is extremely interesting and an easy read. Be sure to keep up with the reading guide or be ahead. It's too easy to skip one day and end up falling behind.
i really liked the book, and the class is totally manageable.
This class provided an overview of Don Quixote and several possible interpretations.
I felt like the material and professor were really interesting but the way the class was taught didn’t really reflect that.
reading. so much.
I was really eager to come in and learn further about a book that I've known and loved for so long, but there seemed to be little to no enthusiasm from the other students, and sometimes the professor himself.
TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! this class is perfect: EASY and INTERESTING. I've always wanted to read Don Quixote because its a classic and everyone should read it, but i know that if i tried to read it on my own i wouldn't have appreciated it as much as i do now that I've been taught Don Quixote in a class setting. this class is super easy and low key, only homework is reading Don Quixote and there is 1 easy midterm and a final that is mostly take home. it's clear that the professor is passionate about Cervantes' works and Don Quixote, but he is a little hard to understand. you have to go to class to succeed.
GREAT class! The professor is really enthusiastic about Don Quixote and I love the book because of his insight. If you ever thought about reading Don Quixote, I would STRONGLY recommend this class because it will illuminate way more than you might have picked up on just reading by yourself.
The class discussions and lectures were informative but rather dry. If you want to specifically learn about Cervantes and Don Quijote, then this is a great class, but if you are looking for a distro and have no prior interest in Don Quijote, you may want to look elsewhere.

Comments
Great lit class if you're interested in Latino Studies. I really enjoyed all of the pieces that were chosen for this class which helped understand latinos in the US and latino literature as a literary cannon.
This class is really easy, at least the way Professor Aparicio teaches it a lot of the books are repetitive, and kind of about the same thing. TA Maria is really great, she writes extensive commentary on all of the short papers, does her best to hand these back in a timely fashion so we can apply her notes to are next paper and is a really fair grader. I think a big problem I had with Professor Aparicio was that she didn't really create an environment where people were comfortable to share their reactions to the material, especially not students who were non-Latino˺. Sometimes she would respond to non-Latino˺ students' comments as though to suggest that they were not warranted to make observations about this literature, or that they were generalizing. Of course these kinds of comments are going to be generalizations; it is understood even of social science research that because it requires the compilation of several specific and variant cases into one analyses, the conclusions drawn are generalizations, and can contradict personal experience. I also think its inappropriate to call out specific students in the class for being Latino˺, it really divides the class into people who have "a right" to speak on behalf of the Latinx community and the people who do not, and who therefore should not be commenting on Latino˺ literature. And then she wonders why nobody speaks up in class.
I really enjoyed professor Aparicio's teaching style. She is very accessible to students and allows many interpretations of the text in class discussions. The timing of assignments is not ideal. We did not have a lengthy writing assignment until week 5 and then three more jammed in the last three weeks of the class followed by the final. In general, though, this is a great course, very interesting material, and not overly demanding.
Take this class! I loved it. Did a lot of group work, but the readings were so manageable and so interesting. Aparicio wants to know how you feel about the readings so speak up. Only thing I did not like was how we had Canvas posts due the morning before class day, so definitely no procrastinating allowed.
This is a great class to take. The work load is light however I did wish there was more group discussion so that the class doesn't get boring.
Overall a great course. I was disappointed by a lack of classroom engagement at first, but it didn't take aware from the course material, which was fantastic. Aparicio is an amazing professor and she makes each class enjoyable.
Amazing class. Loved the readings, the professor, and the discussions. Readings are pretty easy to keep up with and are often really interesting to read. Only four 2 page essays, weekly discussion prompts, and a final paper, so it was very manageable.
This was a great course. All of the texts were interesting and Aparicio did a great job of pointing out the most important ideas of every text.
class is not too hard, 4 essays and one final essay 8-10 pages, try to participate in class or you will lose a lot of points, can only miss class twice
I really enjoyed this class! As a Spanish major, I will say I didn't know before that THIS CLASS IS TAUGHT IN ENGLISH! Regardless, we talked a lot about the latino˺/x experience in the US and the stereotypes, myths, and realities associated with that experience. All of the poetry and novels we read were actually really interesting and enjoyable to read. We had responses to the reading due at 9 AM the days before class, which was sometimes stressful but nice because it forces you to get the homework done a few days before class. We had around four 1-2 page papers, where you analyzed the text and a final 8-10 page paper. IF YOU ARE A SPANISH MAJOR, and NOT a native Spanish speaker, it's definitely difficult to translate the discussions you have in class into a paper because apart from the responses all of your essays have to be in Spanish. Just be aware it's very doable but was definitely more difficult
this class was super interesting and made me think a lot more about latinidad and what i means. i liked almost all of the texts that professor aparicio picked.
The lecture was great and really stimulating. I enjoyed reading the texts because they were all very eye opening and offered a different aspect of Latino history. Even if you're not Latino you should take this course because it offers a better understanding of how Latinos have been treated in the U.S., and how literature has been affected.
This was a fun and interesting course, but I felt that the prompts for the papers, which are 10% of your grade each, could have been a lot more specific and that the grading on them was a bit hard to follow, as in sometimes it felt like there was an answer that was expected.

Comments
I didn't learn much in the class, and it was really unorganized. Prof Fernandez-Morera is fun, but I felt lost in his class the entire time, which made the final presentation really difficult.
This class was very disorganized, and I'm not sure what I learned from it. Fernandez-Morera is a nice man, but this class was unpredictable. We had no idea when we would be giving presentations and received little feedback on the work we did do. He is extremely knowledgeable about the topic of medieval Iberia, and I wish I could have learned more in this class.
We didn't exactly stick to the syllabus, and the course was pretty dull at times, but overall it was relatively easy and pushed me to think in new ways about ancient texts.
The material is interesting but the class is pretty disorganized and we fell super far behind schedule. Final presentation (25% of grade) and final paper (50% of grade) topics are assigned by the professor but there's still a good amount of flexibility in what direction you want to take with those, and the shorter response papers are pretty open-ended and you can choose something that interests you.
Fernandez-Morera is the best professor I've had at Northwestern. There are various response papers˿ive minute orals based on the readings. Then, you are assigned a subject for a 20 minute presentation and 8 page paper. Those are the only real assignments of the quarters.
Overall, the assignments are pretty straightforward, this class is bound to fall behind
Interesting course, your grade will be based on 3-5 5 min oral response, a 20 min oral report, and a paper in the end.
Pretty laid-back course. The majority of the class is student-run through presentations and the like, which can be good or bad. The class lost focus midway through the course and struggled to stay on schedule. The final paper still gave an opportunity to examine a topic in-depth, which was nice. Dario F-M is wonderful as always, but he could have done more lecturing in the later stages of the class to keep things more focused.
Pretty disorganized course. Primarily student presentations, I wish Professor Fernandez-Morera would have lectured more because that's when the class was at it's strongest. Oh well, still very little work and the subject matter is interesting if you like history.

stewart adams. that is all. he is the man. do not take this course with anybody else. he is amazing.
The final exam was very grammar heavy which was upsetting considering the lack of grammar we had learned through the course. Adams prepares us well when it comes to discussing the stories and movies we see.
This is a very fun low stress course. Almost no homework. As long as you attended class concepts were not difficult.
Prof Adams is the best guy ever. Hilarious, entertaining and just a world class kind of guy. If you can take a class with him, do it
Take Spanish with Adams! He is so chill and makes the class easier. There are a few quizzes, two exams, and a presentation. Not really any homework. Definitely recommend for an easy Spanish class.
This class was cool because you learned through movies and stories!
Adams is one of my favorite professors, he has so much knowledge and teaches the class extremely well.
This class was not difficult. Lots of movies to watch and the course focused on controversial topics rather than becoming a better speaker or writer.
I really enjoyed this course. All of the readings, movies, and other resources we used were very interesting and allowed for us to talk about popular topics in the world today in a Spanish context. Professor Adams is an awesome professor.

Comments
This course was challenging for me, especially the grammar aspects. However, there are lots of opportunities for points, so if you do poorly on an assignment, there are chances to make up for it.
Good class and professor. However, if you are reluctantly taking the class, due to the WCAS foreign language requirement, it will not be particularly interesting.
This is a relatively easy course. Rifka is a great teacher and she cares about her students so much. At times, the homework can feel like busy work, but overall the work level is fairly low. The in class activities are usually very fun as well.
This course was a good course to solidify basic Spanish skills to be able to read, write, and speak the language effectively. The course was structured in a way that allowed students to get what they put into it but it was not necessarily challenging. Sometimes the homework or requirements on projects were unclear, but Rifka was really good at helping students who reached out her with any questions.
The class was great. I would definitely recommend taking it.
While the movies that were required to watch in order to score well on exams and complete homework were not always the most interesting, Rifka made sure that classes were interesting and engaging.
This course was incredible. Rifka has the biggest heart of anyone I've ever met and she is devoted to making sure you genuinely learn. The class itself was also not too bad, as long as you watch the movies she assigns and understand them, you're looking at a solid grade, probably an A. Just talk in class and talk to Rifka! She'll love it.
It was refreshing to learn about Spanish literature and film in the class, which otherwise I would not have been exposed to.

Comments
Good class, fairly easy, but there is a lot of homework and it is time consuming. Asha is a great professor, she's really patient and takes her time explaining what we don't understand.
This course is a lot of work, especially with Profesora Nagaraj. She assigns two hour long movies during the week, and often assigns several hours worth of readings and worksheets even as she expresses concern about our stress levels. She grades very harshly- I don't believe it is possible to get an A without perfect use of accent marks. Expectations are unclear for most of the written work, but all of the conversational parts of class are very helpful. Even though I hated this class, I am more fluent than I was at the start.
Asha is amazing! I’m so happy I took this class with her. I liked that we broke into small groups to discuss and put what we’ve learned in practice. I liked that we discussed movies and poems, as well as important social issues. Asha made class very fun and comfortable
I thought the course was well designed in its use of movies to keep the class engaged. I highly recommend continuing this in the future.
I enjoyed the course and how small the class size was. There was a lot of homework, and, at times, I felt that the homework was tedious and/or unnecessary. Prior to taking this course, I had not planned to continue taking Spanish after freshman year of college which influenced my feeling that the homework was tedious.
Well-taught course. Asha is a very kind, patient teacher and seems to genuinely care if you succeed. Keep in mind that you will watch some movies, but otherwise, the homework is pretty chill. In-class group work felt forced and painful to me, but other aspects of the course were fine. Also, the textbook is exorbitantly overpriced imo, and I wish we didn't have to purchase it.

Comments
I was a bit worried about how well Iɽ do in a class where Iɽ have to work with spoken Spanish a lot, but the class proved to be very manageable.
Movies were long but fairly compelling. I think it would be better for teaching Spanish if Prof. Adams spoke more Spanish but it did help at times that he spoke about the movies in English.
My main concern with spanish is to become fluent eventually. this course helped me to move closer to my goal.
Prof. Adams is a genuinely nice guy and a fairly easy grader, so if you are taking 125 to fill language requirement, definitely take it with Adams. But if you are trying to actually learn Spanish, I would recommend somebody else. If you remember Spanish from high school, you don't really need to study more than the required assignment, which is, to be honest, annoying sometimes.
It's very easy to get a high grade, with a little bit of effort. I went into the midterm and final with 30 minutes of studying beforehand, and still managed to get above a 95%. It's worth the investment to get the textbook, but the optional grammar booklet is unnecessary if you can utilize online resources. Points were fairly well-spread, from discussion, homework, tests, and writing assessments. Homework load is quite low, and syllabus clearly says the dates in which these assignments are due.
I think the course was relatively easy, and not too much work at all.
This is a course based around reading and watching spanish movies. While there is a review element for grammar, be prepared to spend a decent amount of time reading poems and watching films. Before going into this one should have a strong foundation of the basics of the language
If this class is a requirement for you, like most people, TAKE IT WITH THIS PROFESSOR. He's awesome. Very low-stress, only engaged in interesting, useful conversations about culture in Spanish-speaking countries. No pointless worksheets.
I don't think 125 was the best Spanish class I've taken, nor do I think I'm going to continue with Spanish, but it was a good course to cap things off. Overall pretty chill, except for that they expect you to watch five full movies, which isn't too feasible for a college student.
Professor Adams is the best! Easily the best Spanish professor I have had at Northwestern. He is incredibly relaxed and low key while simultaneously stimulating interesting and effective discussion during class periods. He doesn't inundate you with busy work and instead focuses on the topics that actually matter. Definitely take this class with Adams!

To be successful in this course, you'll need to have a strong memory about the movies you watch and the literature you read. While this is not impossible for every students, students who are concerned about getting every possible point will not be successful in this course.
This was a great class! Profa Teresa is a wonderful professor.
Good continuing spanish class if you want to review high school and ensure you're prepared for college level classes
A lot of work outside of class but it was good practice
The course is a lot of work, including watching movies and reading stories/poems. There's online homework and writing homework along with the reading and watching. The stories and movies were difficult to understand but the discussions afterwards in class helped us to better understand the material. The discussions in class were often interesting and the professor was good at facilitating them. The homework was manageable and the tests weren't very difficult as long as you studied.
This was a fun class. I feel like I definitely improved my Spanish speaking abilities, and the exams and quizzes really force you to learn the new grammar points. Watching and discussing movies was fun though some were very long. Super site is helpful for learning the vocab and practicing the grammar. Professor Villanueva is really fun, laid back and nice. Overall I enjoyed this course.
The movies and readings were difficult to understand, but review in class made them manageable.
This course helped me improve on my Spanish language skills. I learned a lot of new material that I never learned before. There are a lot of homework assignments, but they help prepare for the quizzes and exams.
this class can be a bit boring sometimes if you're already good with grammar, but you can learn a lot about Hispanic culture. there are lots of great in-class activities too
This class will help you improve your speaking and writing skills.
Teresa is not too hard and I had a fun class group which made taking a Spanish class (something I didn't want to do) a more enjoyable experience.

Comments
Challenging and fast-paced. However, if you have some background in Spanish and are a good learner, it's manageable as long as you stay on top of grammar.
The class was appropriately interesting, and Asha worked very hard to motivate people to participate. The movies could be very long for one night of homework.
Good course, good balance of speaking and reading/writing. Learning focussed on reading and going over grammar issues that higher level spanish students typically struggle with, so very useful material.
A fast-paced review of grammar coupled with movies and some reading. Great for reviewing Spanish grammar and learning the structures that will be expected in more advanced Spanish classes.
Not too much work and I liked that I only needed to take one quarter to fill my foreign language requirement
Nagaraj is very knowledgeable and passionate, but she is a very harsh grader. The class focuses nearly completely on audiovisual materials like movies or texts and poems. It is helpful and immersive, but the grammar lessons are often rushed and pushed to the side. The homework is mostly online through an online course (this means you have to purchase books new...) It's mainly multiple choice or true⿺lse which can be problematic for subjective questions.
This class was not as hard as it seems. Of course, it requires a decent amount of work and studying, but if your Spanish skills are good, then it's fine.
I really had a good time in this course, the instructor was great and the movies˺rticles we watched/read helped to apply the information we went over in class.
Good class, rough if no one participates in the discussion.

Comments
This is a good class to take for Spanish major/minors. You have 3 papers to write throughout the quarter and they are not long and you get great feedback on them. There are readings before every class; make sure you read and go to class prepared to discuss them as your grade heavily depends on it.
The readings for this class were often very difficult and took a very long time to read and understand. Class discussions were very helpful in understanding, but they could also be very stressful if you didn't fully understand the readings and therefore did not have very insightful things to say about the text. However, I enjoyed many of the texts that we read, and thought that discussions were interesting. The papers were kind of difficult to write, but they really helped me improve my literary analysis and Spanish writing skills.
Pretty interesting class. I found discussions to be intimidating sometimes, especially because some readings were difficult and Nathalie is not afraid to tell you if she disagrees with your interpretation. But overall, got to read some interesting literature, and Nathalie does a good job of tying in different contexts to the readings.
of all the professors for Spanish 250𯉑𯉠𯉡, Nathalie is the best. take literature with her. she is challenging and expects a lot but males class enjoyable. Participation is a large portion of the grade, which, if you do readings and pay attention in class is really beneficial. Nathalie is really helpful and understanding.
Literature courses aren't my favorite, but the professor was really nice and some of the readings were interesting, so a good class.
It is a hard and time consuming class, but my reading comprehension improved a lot.
it was fairly easy and did not require too much out of me. it really helps you work on your writing skills
I thought the course was excellent with helping me gain the vocabulary to explain and critique parts of the literature that we were reading. The length of the papers also helped me slowly get used to writing analysis about poems or short stories without it seeming too daunting,

Professor Coronado is great! He really cares about seeing you enjoy(/)understand the material and also improve your writing. I felt this quarter my Spanish (vocab and writing) improved more than any other quarter I've been at Northwestern. He's also lovely to talk to in office hours. The quizzes are definitely tricky, not really worth a lot though. I'll miss Wheezy (his dog), well and him too
It was a good class. It was fun at times. Professor would take his dog; it was great. Material is pretty interesting. Material consisted of short stories and poems. Professor understands we might not understand something so he helps us go through it during class.
This is a great class. Every topic discussed opened my eyes to other realities I was not aware of. The work load is manageable allowing yourself to focus on your other classes.
This class was really interesting!
Prof. Coronado is enthusiastic and really wants students to participate and be interested in class. Sometimes the readings were overwhelming but I really enjoyed the class.
Would HIGHLY recommend taking this course! Dr. Coronado is one of my favorite professors at NU. The paper assignments aren't difficult, and going to office hours is really helpful to think through your thesis. I liked a lot of the selected readings, especially those on magic realism. You're not expected to understand what readings mean going into class, as long as you understand the storyline. Dr. Coronado does a good job of making sure we understand what's going on. The quizzes focus on details you may not pick up on when reading a language that's not your first (even if they are more story-line type and not deeper meaning), so be sure to read a couple of times!
The class was straight-forward and engaging, and the texts were interesting. Prof. Coronado is really helpful if you go in for extra help, and his expectations for essays are clear. I learned a lot and enjoyed it.

Reyes was the sweetest and made the class always so so exciting. It was a thrill to be in that class even though some people really did not want to speak spanish.
Super fun class. Reyes is an awesome teacher who genuinely cares about improving your abilities as a spanish speaker. Enjoyed the strong emphasis on conversation, however, was slightly disappointed by how basic of grammar/vocab we covered.
Reyes is great and super sweet! Not a hard class and your Spanish improves a lot
Reyes is very sweet and understanding of other commitments, and really wants you to learn spanish. Pretty easy A if you're decent at spanish, an easy A... type
Prof. Reyes was very fun and enthusiastic, but I don't feel that I learned anything new this quarter
While I had no interest in the course material, the class was alright because. Reyes is a really fun and engaging teacher.
Reyes is incredibly excitable and enjoyable to spend class time with. It was easier than some other Spanish classes to fall behind slightly on material, but Reyes is so kind and fun and helps catch you up.

Comments
Way too much unhelpful busy work is assigned for this class. It takes hours to complete the weekly assignments, and then you need to dedicate even more time to teaching yourself the concepts outside of the assignment, because they are completely ineffective. There's also a huge vocab divide between students from 101 and kids who have taken 4 years of spanish in highschool. Students from 101 are expected to complete assignments and speak in class with way more vocabulary than the into class exposed them to.
It was good for being a required course, but didn't affect my interest in the Spanish language at all. Most of the time the activities were annoying to complete, especially the movies we had to watch outside of class. It was very much an introductory course meant to focus solely on the language and its rules.
I like how the assignments that determine your grade were spread out, no one set of quizzes˾xam can fail you. It was more holistic and allowed for you to shine even if you are not good at one type of assessment
I felt the class environment was very helpful to learning however you always need to pay attention and be prepared (or be good at winging it). There's some busy work sometimes but if you actually do it, it will help you in the long run. The video quizzes aren't so bad but the short videos in link with the book are so give yourself time to understand those. Overall, it's not a bad class as long as you put the effort in (which I suggest doing)!
This course was one of my favorites this quarter. I liked the focus on discussion in class, and I thought that the professor was great.
Lots of HW
The class taught a lot of grammar and vocabulary. A lot of the homework was completing worksheets and watching videos. It was a lot of good practice, but I wish we had gotten to speak more.
This class is fine if you have to take it to fulfill a requirement. Profesora Aubeneau is nice and is clearly passionate about making sure the students are able to hold conversations in consistent, correct Spanish. However, sometimes homework assignments are excessive and her grading is erratic. If you're an introvert, this class will definitely challenge you early on.
This is a traditional language class with frequent vocab and grammar quizzes and homework that takes around 30 minutes. Beyond that though I really enjoyed the discussions we had in this class and my Spanish speaking really improved because we did a lot of in class discussions. I really really enjoyed this class and it’s super super manageable
this is more accelerated then 115, but Nelia made it fun, she's a great teacher
its spanish. you learn spanish, its not too hard or stressful, just do the work and you'll be fine.

Comments
This class is a review of last year, and therefore you are expected to know a lot coming in. Nelida expected too much. I walked out of class feeling stupid instead of inspired because of her comments and corrections.
Typical Spanish course with lots of emphasis on speaking and listening. Most learning is done through the textbook, and class is mostly dedicated to practicing speaking and reviewing homework. Overall good experience with Aubeneau: fair grader, and does what she can to make class enjoyable given the constraints of the course.
Tests were fair, homework didn't take too long for the most part
The material is taught well, but there are too many extra assignments like watching Spanish movies and clips. Moves quickly enough.
I liked using the different medias to learn about cultural material
Requires more studying than 115 sequence.
Nelida is awesome! There is a larger component of participation in 121 than in 101, but the vocab and grammar is mostly a review. The book isn't as good this year and the videos can be a bit tedious and hard to understand
Aubeneau is a really great teacher and one of the nicest people, highly recommend taking this class with her.
This class was such a great class. The material was interesting and I feel more confident in my Spanish skills. The professor knew what she was doing! Great teacher, and a fun class!
Fine class, goes through the important topics of Spanish.

Comments
This class is pretty interesting and the workload is not bad. Part of the curriculum looks at the theory and make-up of different kinds of writing which is something I had never really thought about before. Baez is well-informed and cares about her students, and if you participate in class discussions you can get a lot out of them.
This course is amazing! Profesora Baez is so kind and insightful. She puts a lot of effort into giving students constructive feedback on their essays which helps immensely in turning in polished work. She genuinely cares about students understanding the readings that she assigns, and her enthusiasm for the material makes class discussions so enjoyable.
This class is really interesting, you get to study a variety of genres, authors, and time frames, giving you a good sampling of literature (which might also help you pick more specific class topics later on). The requirements for this are really manageable, do the readings (which aren't too time intensive), present once and write a couple essays. Ana Baez is a really great professor and she gets the class to contribute without pushing too hard, her feedback on essays, projects, and reading are also helpful.
A student COULD learn a lot from this course, if they so chose. This was a very "mature" class in that you got out of it as much as you put into it. Honestly – if worst came to worst – you could get by skipping a reading or too, but if you read them in depth & participated in class, you could also learn so much about both literature and the language.
Really great class with not too difficult of a workload. Profesora Baez is incredible, understanding, and knowledgeable.
I think the student presentations were very helpful.
Low-key frustrated that I bought the $60 textbook. The other book, which was $10 on Amazon, was actually just scanned to Canvas, so also not necessary. But all of the readings could have been found online, half of them were uploaded to Canvas and weren't even in the textbook anyway. I really think that all the readings should just be scanned, I only used the textbook once for a text that I couldn't find online. Aside from that, the class was great, incredibly similar to AP Spanish Lit. There were only five readings I didn't recognize having taken AP Lit. There were no exams, only three essays, two 4-pages and one 6-pages. They were all 20% of our grade, with a presentation also 20% and participation the final 20%. Most people got 10⼐ on the presentation, and the lowest anyone got on the papers was a 90, some with 100. Super easy A. Baez was super excited and really good at explaining the concepts to us.
The curriculum was phenomenal, the first spanish class ive taken at NU that centered content from latinamerica and especially the carribean. I wish that we had discussed some of the ideas further but I understand the limitations of the quarter system
Thought the readings were interesting and prof was really able to help us better understand them and stimulate interest.
This is a good introduction to Latin American (and some Spanish) literary texts. Baez covers a wide range of topics which is pretty ambitious for such a short class. Overall a good class to take as an intro to literary analysis and seminal Latin American texts.

Comments
The readings for the class are usually pretty interesting and we usually got into good discussions about their meanings in class. The entradas got easier as the class went on. I like the set up of having 3 three-page essays. The class was generally engaging and I feel like my skills in writing and analyzing literature have improved.
This class was good, it provided a good basis for literary analysis, as advertised. I enjoyed it for the most part; the readings and discussion posts were largely manageable, except for a few notably difficult and long ones, but we were allowed to skip 2 of the posts. For some, having a reading and post due before every class can be daunting, but I found that I was able to do most of the daily assignments within an hour. Overall a pretty good class.
This was a great class for working on your Spanish writing skills. It's similar to an AP literature type class, but in Spanish, which really pushes you to expand your ability to express more complex ideas in Spanish while also developing analysis skills. There was a short writing assignment in response to the texts for each class, that was occasionally annoying, but I also noticed that it really developed my Spanish by forcing me to practice writing more frequently. Overall, I enjoyed the course.
good class! the same thing everyday, but it's fine
Great class – not too much homework, interesting discussions, and Professor Gough is super helpful and nice. You learn a lot without having to kill yourself.
Gough is amazing! Take this class with her if you can.
Gough is definitely the best Spanish professor I've had at Northwestern. Her feedback is really insightful and shows dedication, and she is really passionate and knows how to get students engaged in the material. The workload is not overbearing in the slightest and class is mostly discussion based.
This is a tricky course. The workload is manageable, I just got frustrated in class because I didn't know how to add value to the conversation. This seemed like a standard high school english class that is just advanced to be college level and in Spanish.
Great teacher, talked a lot because small class, would highly recommend
This class prepares you for deeper reading in Spanish literature like fiction, poetry, and drama. Every other night you have to write a short response post to your reading, and there's three short papers. Not a lot of work, but lots of discussion, which is very helpful.
