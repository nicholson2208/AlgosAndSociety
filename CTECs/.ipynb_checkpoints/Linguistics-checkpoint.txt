Overall I felt that the course was not very challenging, nor very interesting. Professor D'Onofrio was very helpful and engaging.
This class is the best class I've taken so far here at NU. Honestly, with all my STEM classes it was really nice to have this nice, easier class to go to. The workload is minimal, and if you're juggling Bio and Orgo in the same quarter it's a blessing. The material is really interesting too, and good for a first Linguistics class. There is an experimental requirement, but only 2 experiments (2 hours). Annette is the best! Seriously, she's so chill and an amazing professor.
One of my favorite courses at NU! It's a relatively easy course, but all the material is very applicable and interesting. D'Onofrio is so engaging and approachable!
interesting class but hard graders
Great distro!! Annette is so cute and I loved her.
This was a great class! Annette is the coolest, and she really knows her stuff. The material is very engaging and relevant to current society. After taking this class, I look at language use (mine and others') differently and I think knowledge of sociolinguistics is an important part of an education for anybody who is interested in social justice or social policy.
This was a pretty easy course. There was not a lot of work, and I got to learn a lot about how language and society interact.
This course is interesting because you truly understand the role of language in society and how sociolinguistic variables index certain social meanings that can explain why society has these views. It isn't too time consuming on a weekly basis with only about 50 pages of reading a week and a two-paragraph reading response every week. The linguistic analysis were interesting and something I had never done before. The Quantitative Data Analysis Assignment was specifically difficult because it is the first one and you dont really know what they are looking for. The next one is on Style and is much easier. The final paper is difficult and took a very long time but overall the course was fine.
This course is very interesting and Prof is really good at filling the time so, although it's a long lecture-style class, it almost never drags. I definitely recommend doing the readings over the weekend before they're due because the 5:00 deadline is easy to forget about until the day of and 30 pages is too much to cram. The class is really what you make it but Annette is engaging and is quite reasonable with the assignment expectations.
Not only was this class informative, it was also a lot of fun. The class discussions were intriguing and provided a lot of perspective on language that I wouldn't have had otherwise, and the assignments helped me learn a lot about how to write research papers.
The class felt more like a large discussion period with some academic material rather than a lecture, which made it super enjoyable. If you're interested in anything related to sociology and curious into how linguistics plays a role- definitely take this class. Assignments are all super doable and the 2 papers during the quarter (including the final paper) are as well.
This class was great. Prof. D'Onofrio is really nice and excited to teach. This class is really easy, one paragraph reading response a week. Two midterm essays and one final essay. Interesting subject matter.
I loved this course. I took this class for fun and it did not disappoint. Professor D'Onofrio is great.
Really great class, interesting topics, cool professor, and great discussions about relevant topics regarding language as an identity marker for age, race, gender, orientation, social class, etc.
I LOVED this class. The readings were engaging, the lectures were interesting, and the professor is great! It's eye-opening to look at how language affects society and vice versa, and I recommend this class to everyone. The projects and papers we had to do took a bit of time but were worth it because they were so cool and not ordinary research papers.
I believe that the course helped me observe linguistic phenomenon in a new light, exposing me to issues that I hadn't considered before from both a linguistic and social view point. The instruction in the class was done very well, and I learned a lot from both the readings and the class lectures.
Incredibly easy and still interesting. Gets repetitive, but D'Onofrio is a gem. I wouldn't take this class if she wasn't teaching it, but if she is, Iɽ say this is a fun, easy distro.
A solid course. Well taught and interesting material. Workload not bad
If you have any interest in linguistics take this class!! It's not a heavy workload although the projects can be time consuming. Most of the readings were enjoyable and supplemented what we talked about in class. Annette is a great professor!
This course gave me a much deeper understanding of some topics I knew a little about already, and raises some very interesting points on social justice concerns.
I definitely recommend this course if you are at all interested in the way people talk, because it is very cool to see a linguistic explanation of why people talk the way they do.
This class was somewhat interesting and not that challenging. I thought the readings and the materials that had to do with society today were interesting, but some of the other materials were dense and boring. Overall, an easy distro that doesn't require prior knowledge on the subject.
Annette is a great Professor! Passionate about linguistics and makes class interesting and fun.

Comments
I was most interested in seeing the sentence structure and learning more on that, though I still was confused after class. The handouts do help out a lot in giving examples, many of which are explained during class. I do recommend this class for a distribution requirement, as it is not exactly easy, still challenging, but still easy enough to get through it without worrying to much about homework load and time needed to complete it.
Was not excited to take this class as am not a math person but it was completely manageable and I feel like I learned a lot. The only annoying part of the class is that you have to turn assignments in through a computer, you can't turn in any form of hand written work and that is annoying when you have to make a ton of trees that can be very time consuming .
It was an okay distro for formal studies. You have to be prepared to actually go to class and put a lot of time into the assignments, but thankfully there weren't a lot of them.
go to lecture!! even though it is super boring you need to go to lecture to do well on the four take home assignments and take home final.
Not a good class. Went in interested in exploring a new area, but was just disappointed. Would not recommend.
Interesting course overall. I took it as a distro and enjoyed it. Masaya is a good teacher, and you don't need a book for his class which is a big plus.
This class was really interesting, with a lot of cool material that will blow your mind a little bit because it's stuff you would never think about on your own. Masaya is great, and he makes lecture fun with all his bad jokes. He's also amazing at explaining things in different ways for people who don't understand them and has never-ending patience in his willingness to explain. Read the handouts he posts on Canvas BEFORE class, and everything will make much more sense; even if you don't understand it in writing, the professor will explain it and you'll be less confused because you at least primed yourself for the info.
The material was interesting, but the course felt disorganized and some of the homework assignments were unreasonably hard.
Although this class is interesting, I would not recommend taking it under any circumstances unless the homework format is changed. Masaya only accepts computer drawn word trees that take hours to create, even when the conceptual work is straightforward. It's an enormous waste of time on a class that I actually would have enjoyed otherwise.
It was a casual and easy distribution requirement, I have gotten nothing out of it.
I liked Professor Masaya, and he did his best to explain each topic to us. He would ask us repeatedly if we understood before moving on to a new topic. However, by the end of the term, everything had gotten very, very complicated, and it's really easy to make small mistakes on the homework and exam that add up to a lot of missed points. I liked the lecture, but the last two homework assignments and the exam were very difficult.
not as easy as expected
The content got really confusing a lot of times, and the professor was not really helpful in the class. I found self-studying via handouts and the text book more effective. It was good to have all the assignments taken home, but they were extremely time-consuming and emotionally exhausting.
tree diagrams are awful but this class is pretty cool. Masaya is super cool and a great professor. the English language is trippy, yɺll.
The course only gets challenging towards the end -- the last homework assignment (before the final) took me nearly 10 hours, but most others took me closer to 3 or 4. The most time-filling part of this class is making all those trees. The subject is not inherently interesting, but Yoshida is engaging and it fills a distribution requirement.
It seems really easy for the first half of the quarter, but the last homework and the final are pretty difficult. Masaya is a fun teacher, but so much of the class is spent answering student questions that aren't that helpful. You don't have to go to all the lectures.
Really interesting class, but not an easy distro at all. Take it if you think you can handle taking a more scientific approach to language, not if you're looking to improve on your English skills.
I took this course as a Math/Science distro. It started off fine but then I would just get bored in class and zone out. The homeworks, although there are few, probably took me over 12 hours to complete. Each tree drawing took me 30-40 minutes to draw. The last homework was the worst. I never will use this learning in my everyday life so I am not too stressed about it.
Masaya is a KOOKY guy but also a really fun lecturer. I have never been in a room of so many confused people that are also still interested in what the lecturer is saying. Except for the guy that sat in front of me every day and wrote a novel on his computer. It's not a bad plot, tbh.
It was near impossible to learn anything in this class as the class time was exceptionally tedious. At first the homework was very simple and could be completed just by looking at the additional handouts, the fourth homework assignment completely out of left field and literally took me twelve hours to complete. It was also due the Saturday of thanksgiving break. I really struggled to understand the latter half of this course.
I wish there would have been a book or source to reference other than a somewhat-jumbled course pack.
Daunting homework assignments, but reasonable experiment requirements.
If you're not a math person, this is the perfect class for a formal studies distro. 4 homework assignments, no midterm, and take home final
This was an extremely frustrating course for me. This may just have been my case, but I had a very hard time understanding the concepts taught in the class. Masaya is a nice and funny professor, and maybe other students knew what they were doing, but after attending all the lectures, taking pages of notes, and attending both TA's office hours, I still had no clue what was going on and felt stressed out and frustrated while doing each homework assignment.
Honestly, I forgot I was taking this class most of the time. There was so little work to do outside of class. I found most classes to be slow and got bored, but I know other people really enjoyed the pace.
I learned that language highly relied on its structures. The class was more like exploring different language phenomena together than listening to a lecture.
All of the assignments were take-home, including the final, which I found convenient. The online handouts were very useful in completing the homeworks but I would definitely recommend attending and taking notes during the lectures in order to get the most out of the course.
I'm interested in linguistics, so I appreciated the discussions on sentence and word formation. I felt like what we were doing was solving logic puzzles the whole time, and, if that's not your thing, Iɽ take a pass on this class. Some of the concepts are difficult to grasp if you've never thought about things like "why is language the way it is?"
I will not be taking a linguistics course again because it is really confusing and unnecessary, but I enjoyed it to an extent. Masaya is super cool and you will get lost if you don't go to lecture, so it's definitely worth coming to class.
Straightforward course - there's nothing unexpected on the homework or final. Notes are given out at the start of the course and Prof goes over all of them in the lectures. Notes are good but not extensive, so go to office hours. This class is easy if you put in the effort and attend the lectures.
The lectures were informative and well structured. However, I was frustrated that the material taught was not founded in concrete, current materials. This made it difficult to research˾xpand upon what was taught in class outside of class. Overall, a great intro class for anybody interested in linguistics.
Lectures were so bad. Could not see where anything was going at all. Notes provided on canvas were virtually no help. Impossible to follow what they mean.
I enjoyed this course. However, I think that had more to do with the professor than the course content and structure, and I will say that the last two homework assignments were probably the most difficult assignments I've ever done. Also please please PLEASE let students turn in tree diagrams on paper!!! I cannot say this enough: I think the homework assignments would have taken half the time if we were allowed to hand-draw tree diagrams.
I thought this was a very interesting class which was extremely important for an understanding of linguistics.
There were days I really enjoyed this class and felt like I was learning a lot, and there were days when I didn't like it as much and thought the instruction could have been clearer. It was a good distribution requirement that was for the most part not too hard, but I do not think I will take more linguistics classes.
This course was frustrating. The instructional materials were a bit difficult to follow. The class didn't seem to follow a clear structure which made the content more difficult to understand.
The class was pretty technical but, overall, you can get by on the class notes.
I did not enjoy this course. I came in interested in linguistics but left hating it.
Extremely interesting course - didn't know much about Linguistics beforehand but learned a lot. Masaya was a fantastic prof and him and the TAs explained key concepts well. Only a few assignments due, but they are time consuming so don't wait until the last minute. The first few weeks of the course may give you a false sense of security but there's definitely a difficulty spike around the halfway point where a lot of people wind up dropping. As long as you go to class and take notes you should be able to keep up, though.
I hated this class so much. Really REALLy uninteresting like painfully boring and has no application in the real world, which they tell you at the beginning but still. Masaya is funny but unhelpful in answering questions. Always has too much going on on the board and poses questions that NEVER get answered. So boring, sososo sBORING, boring
pretty interesting goes into enough depth for an intro class professor great
This was a pretty solid class - a lot harder than I was expecting because apparently he had to make it not an easy A class this year, but it was okay. The lectures were all on a chalkboard/no powerpoint involved which was a bit of an adjustment but I got used to it okay, and he provided lecture packets which were clutch. I would 11⼐ recommend going to class because a lot of the HW questions he actually did in class. A bit boring, but Masaya was relatively entertaining when he wanted to be. The overall structure was 4 assignments and a take home final. The first two were pretty easy; the last 2 and the final were ROUGH so I would recommend starting those early and going to office hours because office hours were the only reason I did well in this class. Go to the TAs' office hours!!!!!!!
There wasn't a ton of work, but the homework were difficult to complete because of how disorganized and unclear the lectures were. Meeting with TAs was helpful, but homework assignments took inordinate amounts of time because of how long it takes to make sentence trees on the computer.
I had no prior knowledge about what linguistics was or how to study it, and I was hoping this class would gauge my interest in the course. The study of why grammar functions the way it does was pretty interesting, but I needed an engaging teacher to help me, and I assume, other individuals unfamiliar with the subject, with the material. I did not get that - I can tell the professor understands linguistics and gets a grasp on it, but his explanations to the class were presented in a very broken and confusing manner. Oftentimes, it was not clear what he was saying or trying to explain, and I could tell the class was scared to ask clarifying questions for fear of further confusion. The only thing driving me to complete the course at the end of the quarter was to be done with the distribution requirement.
A fine lecture but terrible presentation of content especially in the homework.
Would not recommend this course with this instructor. He is clearly brilliant, but the topics are confusing under the best of circumstances, and his course materials are often unreadable due to their poor syntax even to the point that the written handouts give incorrect instruction. In addition, the few (very confusingly formatted and worded) assignments are graded without sufficient time or information provided for students to learn from what they got wrong.
Okay so: I never went to class. Except the first day. And so honestly, yeah you can get by the quarter without going. BUT be forewarned- the lecture notes are not comprehensive at all (and a lot of times actually it has errors). So you're going to have to supplement your at home learning with videos etc. idk how I did the final but I definitely felt myself wishing Iɽ gone to class the last half of quarter and also taken good notes Bc apparently a lot of the hw/ final examples are written out in class. So is this an easy A? No freaking way (unless there is a curve). But can you get an easy A-˻+ ? For sure- if you're willing to teach yourself material and GO TO OFFICE HOURS. You can't skip class and not go to OH if you want a great grade.
A low stress class that does teach some nice fundamentals of setence trees.
The course was alright, I just found the content extremely boring and unexciting, which made it hard for me to do well.
This course started off okay. The lectures were fairly boring but I'm here for a distro credit so, no harm done there. Prof Yoshida is a funny guy, but there's only so much you can do to liven up word/sentence structure. Things started to go sideways when it came time to do the assignments. IGNORE ALL CTECS SAYING YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO LECTURE. They changed the course content to make it harder and if you blow off lecture you will be screwed six ways to Sunday. Why? Because the notes posted online have gigantic content gaps in them, and what is posted is not always the easiest thing to decipher. Simply put: everything that's due for the class is posted on day one, but you will not do well on the later assignments/the final if you fail to attend lecture. Not to mention that they will take you hours to complete. This is definitely not the easy A it apparently once was.
Super interesting class, time-consuming homework.
The material was relatively interesting, but the professor doesn't explain the concepts very well, and the course packets he gave out were unclear. However, the workload was fair, and as long as you keep up, you'll do fine.
This course was interesting. It really helps you to think about language in a different way. If you go to the lectures, the material is all very doable and logical. The professor genuinely wants to help students understand the material and will always answer any questions you have!! This is a great class to take if you're somewhat interested in linguistics or want to learn more about how it works.
The beginning of this course is easy and the first few homework were not bad at all. However, around week 6 or 7, the course got impossibly difficult and the problems that were done in class and in the notes did not match the homework problems at all.
Very hard, really difficult to understand materials, unorganized, and not practical or intuitive at all. The only saving grace is Professor Masaya, he's hilarious and very smart but there is little to no support to learn the material.
This class could get pretty dreary at times, but it is important to go to class and take notes because a lot of the trees he draws in class are very helpful in answering the homework questions. I'm not sure how helpful recording would be. It is SOO important to stay current on the worksheets and make sure you understand them because they are basically all you need to answer homework and they are very helpful (maybe even more than the lecture) in making you understand the logical flow of arguments he uses to build up concepts. Apart from this, this class is pretty non-stressful. All your grade is just take home assignments.
interesting course; many tree diagrams

Leddon is AWESOME I loved this class because the content was interesting, and she always found a way to bring it back to current day events
A very thought provoking and useful course
I really enjoyed this class! never taken a linguistics but that is absolutely not necessary for this class. Erin is a great professor. Quizzes and exams are very straightforward. Lectures were not too bad. i actually enjoyed going to this class!
It's a great class with an AMAZING professor, but there are some drawbacks. There are too many readings -- you can get by with just skimming them though. Realistically by the end I wasn't doing readings and just studying powerpoints. That seemed sufficient for at least a B+˺-. It helps to just have a basic understanding of prejudice before (like from PA training or something). The format is one midterm exam, one final exam, two research briefs (Like 4-5 page essays), and two quizzes. You also have to submit reaction thoughts before every class which is ljust a short comment on the reading with a question or two
TAKE THIS CLASS. Grading is super fair, if you put in minimal effort and study a little, it's very easy to get an A. Also, the material is super interesting, and i'm even considering a minor in linguistics now. Highly recommend this class to everyone
This class had some cool topics so I thought it was fine
Literally easiest A I've ever gotten--never did reading or homework and aced stuff
Learned a lot about language and language use in general.
The things I learned in this class were very applicable to the real world. The readings can be a lot but can be skimmed for sure. The tests are very fair and clear. The research briefs were interesting to write, and did not take that long to do. I really enjoyed this course! Prof Leddon is amazing too!
This is a really good class to take, especially as a distro. Professor Leddon is really enthusiastic and the actual content of the lectures is interesting and the workload is definitely manageable.
Professor Leddon is great! She puts a lot of information on the lecture slides so if you miss class it's not a big deal, but class is interesting and going definitely makes it easy to do well on the exams! Great distro.
This class is an incredibly easy, low-time commitment distro˾lective. Prof. Leddon is very helpful and engaging, and the class material is thought provoking and interesting. This is a great class.
This class is boring but really easy. You don't have to do the reading or even really come to class, all she does is read off the powerpoints word for word and she posts the powerpoints online- so if you just study those you're fine. Take Ling 220 Language and Society with Annette D'Onofrio for a much more interesting and engaging course of similar material.
Great class! Super interesting. Not a cake walk, but if you do the readings and go to class you'll do well. Professor Leddon is incredibly knowledgeable on the topic, passionate about what she teaches, and really wants students to enjoy and do well in the class. Highly recommend.
I wanted to learn about the power of words in perpetuating inequality, and the course provided some insight into this, especially in areas that I had never even considered a possible source of contention
Easy class but a lot of reading
What I was most interested in was learning how much of an impact language has in society. People always think of prejudice in race and religion, but there is also prejudice in language.
This class is rather basic, and the texts are informational, so it can be rather pedantic as opposed to having interesting discussion. VERY easy to do well, but the exams take themselves too seriously.
Professor Leddon did a great job at teaching us the basics of linguistics and how the topic we are learning can be applied to our everyday lives. She is genuinely concerned with how each of her students are doing and makes an effort to remember our names. She is by far the most approachable professor I have met and I would love to take another course with her. Her exams are fair and not challenging at all if you attend her lectures and review her slides. Overall, this was a great class that definitely made an impact on my college career and life.
Amazing and interesting class. The second half of the quarter is a little more technical...
Great class! Professor Leddon is very engaging and uses relevant examples. The materials were helpful for my understanding. The exams and quizzes are pretty straightforward - if you come to lecture, pay attention, and review the slides you'll probably do pretty well
A great distribution requirement -- it will teach you to become socially aware of how language affects different aspects of everyday life.
Class materials are interesting, but it seems the evaluation methods are rather bad. The two exams and quizzes became "memorization of slides" instead of grasping the material and build up on them. Perhaps writing papers would be a better choice.
This class will very possibly change the way you think about language and how it interacts with our day-to-day life. I highly recommend it.

this class is very interesting but can be a bit slow moving. but professor gundlach is the best and you will definitely improve your writing skills.
Professor Gundlach is the epitome of effective and meaningful teaching. He always uses class time well and is engaged with the class and his students, and following the nature of this course, gives a voice to all his students in class and also through the topics that they wish to pursue. I really enjoyed this first-year seminar.
This is such a good seminar! Professor really tries to help with your writing and provides valuable feedback. Is a lot of work in the beginning but mellows out a lot around midterms season. Class could get a little boring because professor really likes to talk but honestly wasn't that bad. Definitely recommend
This class was a lot more work than I expected it be. There is a lot of reading to do, several essays to write, and a decent amount of busy work. Professor Gundlach was a very good professor and very wholesome, and the class content is super interesting, but it was a decent amount of work.
Lots of readings in first half of course. Second half was more writing focused. Lots of essay revision, so this is not good for anyone who like to just write the paper the night before, but expect to get better at writing. Prof clearly cares about students, but talks like he's leading some kind of group meditation with lots of flowery language (idk how else to describe it) and each class period is very structured with little room for open discussion about the material.
This is hands down the best class I've taken at Northwestern. This is the first teacher I've had that actually cared about his students as well as their progress in the course. He wanted to see every student improve. If you put forth your full effort in this class, there is no doubt you will succeed. At Northwestern, Iɽ had some bad experiences with previous writing teachers, however, this teacher truly made me feel confident about my writing abilities again. Iɽ highly recommend taking this course. I learned so much about the writing process, and I can actually say that my writing improved under Professor Gundlach's guidance. Furthermore, class discussion was always stimulating. I loved how much interest Professor Gundlach showed in topics that interested each and every one of the students. This was the most enjoyable class I've taken as well as the class in which I learned the most.
Great class! Really opened my eyes to college-level writing. Would definitely recommend.
This is my favorite course so far!!! Prof. Gundlach is an amazing instructor and his seminar has the perfect balance between the theoretical side of voice in the beginning of the class and the voice that you want to explore as a writer taking a linguistics class. You get so much freedom with your essays and can pursue whatever excites you the most! The class environment is very friendly as well. I strongly recommend this course, even if you are not super interested in linguistics. What you will get out of the class experience depends entirely on you and Prof. Gundlach is only going to help you figure out what you want to write about and what will work best for you as a writer. I just loved the class.
This seminar was very interesting and wasn't too much work. Also, Prof. Gundlach is a great teacher and is really good at making students better writers. Regardless of your current writing ability, he will work with you in conferences and in class in order to give you the tools to make it that much better. Highly recommend putting this one towards the top of your list.
Professor Gundlach was so kind and accommodating. He's always there to help students. Offers honest feedback and advice. Really cares for the students and their growth. Learned valuable lessons regarding the writing process.
Professor Gundlach was amazing. He's so genuinely enthusiastic about the subject, and really pushed students to do their best work and writing. The course is more writing focused, with a nice amount of linguistics thrown in, but it's really interesting regardless. P. Gundlach is super understanding, and wants students to succeed. You have to put work into this class, but he makes it very enjoyable to do so. Overall, a very rewarding course.
This course is a pretty basic first-year seminar. It mainly consists of readings, class discussions and essay writing. Professor Gundlach is incredibly nice and obviously very passionate about what he teaches. The classes might get a bit dull as the professor is very soft-spoken, but overall the class was pretty nice.
This was one of my favorite courses at NU. Professor Gundlach is wonderful—he really engaged the class in discussions and was available and accessible for questions and essay writing guidance outside of class. The class has four essay assignments, culminating in a self-driven research paper on a topic of your choice. Because of the research and writing experience in this course, I feel well-equipped and confident to go on and pursue research papers in othe classes. The subject matter is also fascinating and very far-reaching—you’d be surprised how much applies to the human voice (music, writing, creativity, artificial intelligence, doctor-patient relationships, and more!). I loved this class!
This was a very interesting course where I got to take control on what I wanted to learn about and become a better writer. Professor Gundlach is one of the nicest teachers I've ever had and made the class both valuable and interesting

Interesting readings˽iscussions and frequent writing.
This was a great class. There was a ton of information that was conveyed and sometimes the lectures seemed to ramble a little bit, but the breadth on information related to bilingualism was awesome and the weekly write-ups and discussions were super helpful in processing the information. Would definitely recommend to anyone with an interest in Cog Sci or Linguistics.
I think that the course helped me read linguistics studies more effectively and be able to understand them rather than just regurgitate the information and learn about the neuro aspect of bilingualism
Very easy course with clear expectations and routine; no exams, just weekly written assignments and a final group paper; but because we spent the entire quarter just discussing different research studies, I really don't feel like I learned much
I really enjoyed this class! The first few weeks weren't very challenging but the course definitely gets harder as the quarter progresses. Very manageable workload and Prof Cibelli is very reasonable and understanding of students' needs.
Half the lectures (one day out of two days per week) are discussions in small groups about the paper we read for homework. I am not really sure the meaning behind this but it seems if we used the time for another lecture we could have learned twice as much.
Emily is great! The structure of the course was pretty good, with lectures on one day and discussion of the readings the next day. The studies and topics were interesting. Only assignments were weekly writing assignments and a final group paper.
this class with emily cibelli is amazing (but she isn't teaching anymore). it's not a difficult class. don't need to pay too much attention to lectures because all the homework is reading scientific articles and summarizing them. no tests. final group project which is obnoxious, but very interesting if you DO pay attention.
This course covered a wide range of subtopics related to bilingualism, which is a great introduction to anyone interested in this field.
To be honest I didn't love the professor at first. The pace of this class is pretty slow - it's kind of frustrating when the professor spends fifty (50) minutes on the first day of class going over the syllabus. That being said, she was really, really clear about expectations, which I guess is nice. I liked the discussions we had every Thursday, but I also felt like we weren't covering as much material as I had hoped to because of that. There really wasn't that much work for this class. We had a group final, which I thought would be terrible but ended up being a fantastic experience. The professor grew on me over time. She's really great at facilitating discussion and answering questions, and her lectures are really engaging (most of them). Also her fashion sense is A+ on point all the time. A really interesting class!

Comments
I recommend this class as a solid, easy natural science distro. Dr. Bradlow loves her field, and her passion is contagious. ("I find this absolutely fascinating!" - went on a tangent about how much she enjoys her job and thinking about phonetics.) The quizzes are pretty simple, and the projects are good review materials (I don't see how anyone can do badly on them unless they procrastinated horribly). If you attend lecture and pay attention, you'll be fine. The only drawback is that this class is a long early morning lecture and sometimes I end up falling asleep... even if Dr. Bradlow is a fantastic teacher, it's hard to sit there and stare at a screen for 1.5 hours.
I was originally pretty interested in the class, thinking it would be an easy/interesting distro to take but it ended up being super super boring. You don't need to go to class at all, but definitely study a lot for the quizzes. Its only memorization.
The class was super interesting and I learned a lot, which is exactly why I enrolled in the class. Unfortunately, the class was an hour and twenty minutes long and it was strictly lecture, which was not my favorite part about the course.
This class is not too difficult. Some of the material is very interesting, but some is very boring. Everything, obviously, is relevant to linguistics, just some parts of linguistics are not exciting (like the topic of syllables). Ann Bradlow is alright.
I didn't like the fact that I had to memorize words or concepts that I will probably never use again but all in all I enjoyed the course. Professor Bradlow is very good at conveying information in an easy to understand way and the TAs are always willing to help. It was definitely interesting finding out why we use certain vowels and consonants and how language varies through out the world.
Bradlow was great. Knows her stuff. Tests are pretty easy if you pay attention in lecture. Don't have to study that much.
I thought it was ne of the worst classes i've taken at NU. It didn't have much to do with the professor. more so i thought the topic was super boring
Good, pretty interesting distro. Quiz 1 (midterm) and Quiz 2 (final) were straight forward, no surprises. There's plenty of materials and help from TAs. Easy to study in one day before the exam and do decently well. Would recommend to a friend.
The textbooks for this class are very enjoyable to read, and the topic is interesting. It's easy to do well if you pay attention in class.
Pretty good class. The content is on the whole interesting, but the coursework can be a little tedious and the pace is a bit slow.
go to class and pay attention, study a couple of hours the day before the "quiz" aka midterm and you should pretty much get an A.
This is a great class. Bradlow is very engaging with her students and is an amazing lecturer. Highly recommend.
Good distro, relatively easy, relatively boring.
Cool course that teaches you IPA and the basics of linguistics, prof puts up all lectures slides. HW projects are easy and make up half your grade so pretty easy A.
Theatre majors: TAKE THIS CLASS. It will build off your understanding of the IPA, filling in the gaps that Voice for Performance simply didn't have time to address. It is also fascinating, and provides some insight into the foundations of dialects. This class is also great if you are interested in language or learning multiple languages, or if you're interested in artificial speech recognition and synthesis. Bottom line, this class covers a lot, is a VERY easy distro (I didn't pick up the text books once), and is actually quite interesting.
Unnecessarily difficult. Don't take unless you have a large interest. It wasn't very much work but all of a sudden the tests were extremely difficult. Lectures were boring.
This class is fairly easy. There are only 7 homework assignments and 2 midterms, which aren't too bad. Overall, this course was decent.
Professor Barlow was able to keep me interested for most of the hour and a half in the class, and the material itself was actually pretty interesting as well. Definitely a solid distro.
This class was SOMEWHAT INTERESTING DISTRO, certainly BETTER THAN ANY OTHER SCIENCE CLASS you could take.
Easy class. If you study, you will do well
Great class to take, whether or not you are a linguistics major. Professor Bradlow was always enthusiastic about the stuff we talked about in class, had great slides, and was highly knowledgeable about the subject. The class had assignments about every week or so and two quizzes. Definitely take this class and with Professor Bradlow!
Pretty interesting class. Relatively low stress. "Projects" were essentially worksheets which actually help you learn quite a bit. Good course.
Don't
The class was boring. The lecturer just reads a powepoint for an hour and a half. Memorizing the phonetic alphabet is annoying. The assignments are usually ok but sometimes they get tedious and you wish the better taught so you knew what you were doing.
Professor was great, really interesting course, great distro that's actually really interesting and not too challenging. Tests are not too bad if you study well. Reading is minimal and not totally necessary, though I found it interesting. Seven homework assignments and two exams.
It's a ton of work, but it's worth it. She's the nicest professor and although the assignments are pretty lengthy, if you go to lecture they'll usually pretty much make sense. Exams were easy. Good distro.
This class is fun and not terribly hard. I found the material pretty interesting and it doesn't require a crazy amount of work. Lectures were interesting but sometimes a little repetitive
This class is fine for a science distro but there are definitely better ones. It was cool to learn about at first but then got unnecessarily complicated
This is a fine natural sciences distrio.
Overall this class is pretty easy. If you go to lecture and pay attention you should do just fine in the class.
This course just left me feeling confused. I understood just enough to get by and and disliked how much of it was a gray area. But hey, that's language
Pretty decent science distro; provided you learn IPA, do the projects and attend most lectures you will be good.
This course seemed like it was probably a good one if you were into linguistics. I was not a fan of linguistics. I learned IPA though.
I really liked this course. There is some memorization, but it is really cool to learn how the human sound system works. The first half of the quarter is really important set up for the rest of the quarter.
I came in the class thinking linguistics would be helpful and interesting, but it really felt like another science class with a lot of memorization.
This class required so much memorization and was kind of hard. Wouldn't take it again.
Though it can be boring/heavily memorization based at times, the class was cool.
Easy distro; 6 homeworks which make up 50% of grade; Not very applicable to other parts of life or other subjects
Fairly easy distro. Hardest part is memorizing the IPA.
This is a good class to take if you need a natural science distro. The lectures are kind of boring but the homework and midterms aren't super challenging if you go to class. The reading is not very helpful but there are some homework assignments from the book.
It was boring.

Comments
This class is a very easy A for the natural sciences distro. The lectures can be boring and the textbook doesn't help, but the content is interesting enough.
SUCH A GOOD DISTRO. Useless knowledge but honestly pretty cool when you know it. Cibelli is bae. If you go to lectures you don't have to study and you'll do super well on the exams (if you're ok at memorizing things). TAKEITTAKEITTAKEIT.
This class was dry at times, but the work was very manageable. The tests were fair and the weekly quizzes were very helpful. Overall, I learned a lot.
This course was a good distribution requirement because it was very straightforward and the instructors and TA were always there to help.
Do not fall into the trap of thinking this class is an easy distro because it is not. The material is dull and feels useless and is impossible to learn. I wish I had just taken actual math.
This course was interesting overall, but it gets kind of boring at times. Definitely a good course to take if you want to fill a distro requirement.
Kind of a lot of work if you're just taking this course as a distribution requirement (weekly quizzes, homework assignments, readings, two exams) but it's still a very interesting class and I learned a lot.
Not an easy distro but an interesting one. Lectures were super fast-paced but clear - if you go to class you don't really need to read. Test are easy compared to the difficulty of the material.
This course is not too much work and you will learn a lot of interesting things about linguistics. Prepare to be very confused and lost often, because that's how I spent 90% of the course, but once you figure things out and study them they make more sense. Tests are easier than you think they will be. Scary because you're often confused but not too hard a class overall, and definitely interesting.
Not an easy science distro - you'll get an A if you put in a lot of effort/time though!
The professor is very knowledgeable and very passionate about the course.
I really enjoyed this class. It was a great distro, easy, and super interesting.
It was doable. I studied a lot the day before, did the assignments, and did well on the exams. There are only 2 exams, but they are not bad at all. Pretty easy class
Nice course to start off on if you haven't taken a linguistics class before. It's very heavy in memorization so if that's not your thing you might avoid it but overall I thought the class was fair.
Very interesting subject, lectures were pretty routine, a lot of memorization
This course is awesome if you are interested in language, plus it's a pretty easy distro. There is a lot of material covered, especially in the first half of the quarter, but as long as you go to lecture, take notes on the powerpoints, complete the weekly quizzes/projects, and keep up with the readings, it's easy to get an A.
This was a great distribution requirement that encouraged me to go further into the field of computational linguistics. Emily Cibelli is a great professor. The grading is fair but it is definitely not an easy A.
You don't really need the textbooks for this class. The powerpoint slides are extremely helpful when reviewing for the exam. Stay on top of the material because it builds up and there's a lot of memorization. This is not really an easy distro unless you have a consistent study schedule because it isn't really material that you can cram in one night. There's a lot of concepts and memorization with the IPA chart and other charts that build off of each other.
The assignments were reasonable and easy if u looked at the material. The class was not designed to trick students and the professors and TAs were very helpful in class and outside class.
I really found the class to be interesting, but didn't expect the memorization aspect to it
This was a very easy class, good distro, and you didn't really even have to go to the lectures.
Ling 250 is not a bad class by any means. It is an introductory course so it goes over a lot of the basic phonetics and phonology concepts that you would need to know for further linguistics classes. The content isn't supremely challenging, but there is a good amount of memorization that you need to do. It seems daunting at first but just make sure to continually review the material so you're not stuck cramming. The lectures are pretty tedious because of the sheer amount of content covered in each class so be prepared for that. Professor Cibelli is enthusiastic and eases some of those issues though. The projects and quizzes are EXTREMELY important so do not overlook them, they end up making up the majority of your grade and should be aced if you put the time in. Overall, not a bad class at all very much what you would expect from an introductory course, would recommend.
Good natural science distro. You'll do fine without reading the material (don't spend too much money on the books... they're not worth it). I mark "3 or fewer hours" because I stopped doing the readings (and was fine by it). Sometimes the book will include material that you will not need to know. But, the readings are usually pretty short, so it's very feasible. You have projects every 1-2 weeks, which are basically just worksheets with problems related to the material. They are very easy at the beginning but get a bit tougher at the end. They don't take that long to do. There are also quizzes on canvas you have to do (about 12-15 questions each) that also help you rehearse the material. You can take them over as many times as you want until you get the grade you want. Honestly, I don't know why anyone wouldn't do the projects and quizzes, since they're quick and easy grade boosters and help you rehearse the material throughout the course (I actually kind of liked having them because I honestly wouldn't have really studied the material outside of class until exam time). Just don't forget to do them and you're good. The lectures might get kind of boring, but you can just review the slides afterwards. It's not hard to catch up if you miss a class or two. You do some very simple partner discussions at the end of the lectures if theres time. There are two exams... one after the phonetics unit... and one after the phonology unit. For the final, we have project #6 due. The professor's voice is kind of monotonous, but she does a good job of making the material clear for us. She is also very approachable. You can submit questions anonymously about class material and she will go over it in class the next lecture.
I thought this class would be super easy, but you do have to put a bit of work into it. There is a LOT of memorizing. You don't have to go to lecture, emily posts everything online
Great class! Took it as a distro, but the subject is actually really interesting, and Professor Cibelli is awesome. She was always willing to review topics students were having trouble with. Six worksheets, two in class exams, and weekly Canvas quizzes didn't take up too much time and were a great way to reinforce the material. Would recommend!
Do not need the textbooks, but GO TO CLASS. This is extremely helpful in explaining otherwise abstract powerpoints.
TAKE THIS FOR A GOOD CLASS - if you do your work, it is awesome!!!
This is the easiest one of the linguistics 2X0 sequence. A lot of memorization, but most of the topics covered are really straightforward.
Overall a good class - solid natural science distro. Not the easiest A but very manageable if you pay attention, and the topic is interesting.
Do not buy the books for this class, they are not necessary. 6 Take home projects worth 8% each. 8 quizzes online worth 4% total which should be a guaranteed 100% if you care because you have unlimited attempts. 2 exams are the rest of the grade. More work than I wanted for a distro but not too bad. Go to office hours for help with projects, you will not regret it.
Cibelli is a clear and engaging lecturer, and I personally found the topic very interesting and applicable to other language-related courses (e.g. poetry, foreign languages, etc.). Based on suggestions from previous CTECS, I got a slight head start and began studying the IPA two weeks before the beginning of the course, and ended up way ahead of everyone else. It doesn't take that much effort, but makes a huge difference. Nevertheless, this is a very straightforward course; you won't have any trouble if you learn the IPA reasonably well within the given time frame.
This class was pretty interesting. I definitely enjoyed the first half better. Make sure you are studying throughout, rather than right before the exams, because it's a lot of material that can be tricky to understand. Professor Cibelli is super nice and a good lecturer. However, she covers SO much material throughout lecture that it can be overwhelming...another reason why studying throughout will be helpful. If you study and do all the assignments, the 2 exams are not that difficult.
Prof Cibeli is really nice, course can be a little tricky for internationals
The lecture's contained a lot of information and were really good study tools for me. The lecture style was very clear and she made sure to answer any questions we had and even addressed them in the slides. The tests weren't too hard. If you study like a normal person, you'll do great in this class. The information was pretty fun to learn. For a distro I would 100% recommend. Really not a hard class. Some of her lectures seemed a little drawn out but not too bad.
This course wasn't very interesting, which was disappointing. DON'T BUY THE TEXTBOOKS. Literally one day of reading was assigned - total waste of money. The teaching was good, but lectures were often boring and each class covered an overwhelming amount of material, just slide after slide of facts and categorizations.
the course was very difficult at times as there is a lot to memorize and then learn how to apply and manipulate which was sometimes a lot to handle. after i overcame that part of the course, the theoretical aspects were much easier to follow.
You do not need the books for this course. The slides are great and you can learn a lot by reading them and spending time studying.
Very easy class, and helpful knowledge for everyday life. I didn't think Iɽ be interested in this class, but I really enjoyed learning about everything I was already subconsciously doing while speaking.
EC is a great lecturer and it's pretty easy to follow along. The content is rather dense so I recommend going over the slides after the lecture. you don't really need to do the readings to be honest. The projects and midterms were decent but nothing too difficult. And guys I'm in SESP.
Don't take this as a distribution. Definitely not an easy A or even B+.
A lot of material, still glad I took it as a distro requirement.
Easy course. Take it
This class was honestly harder than advertised. Two exams, second harder than the first, definitely have to study a fair amount for both. Professor Cibelli seems very nice and available to help, but definitely a bit of a challenge. Also a pretty boring class, although she does her best to make it seem interesting, as she herself is definitely very interested in the subject.
Professor is very organized and slide materials are useful. Go to class if possible. Weekly hw (projects) are not very hard but overall the material, for someone completely unfamiliar with linguistics, is quite difficult. Worth learning though.
Not too difficult if you attend all classes, remember to take the weekly online quizzes, and get your experimental credits taken care of. The final is cumulative but I found it easier than the midterm. I bought both of the textbooks for the class, but didn't read them at all. Maybe if I had I would have gotten an A instead of an A-.
The course felt a bit dull at times, but overall it was an okay class and I learned quite a bit.
Emily is a great instructor. I constantly have trouble paying attention in other lectures, but I never had trouble paying attention in this class. Emily is very engaging, and helpful. She knows a lot about the subject and is more than willing to assist. She is also very helpful in office hours. Overall, the class took an amount of work, but a lot less than other courses, and it is very interesting.

Good distro. Material can be challenging, but exams are easy. Cole is a decent professor.
as long as you do all the readings and pay attention in class, you'll totally be fine
Had zero experience with linguistics before this course. This class and Professor Cole won me over. Now seriously studying linguistics.
On the whole this class is rather well taught. Cole's lectures are engaging and she is very interested in the subject matter. The weekly quiz format and the readings are not the best, but it's not a major detriment to the course. I definitely recommend this course for those with any interest in linguistics.
The books are not necessary if you go to class.
I loved this class! I didn't know anything about linguistics before taking the class, but it was very easy to grasp the content from the lectures and the powerpoint slides, which are posted on Canvas and are super helpful when studying for quizzes and midterms. Half the battle is learning the IPA, and that wasn't as bad as I was expecting; once I figured it out, it stuck with me so I didn't even need to study that part of the class for the second midterm. I would highly recommend this class for anyone, especially if you're looking for an easy science distro.
If you need a natural sciences distro, this is a great course to take. It isn't too much work and if you study the midterm and final are very doable.
This class had a lot of memorization (i.e. learning IPA symbols and the classification of sounds), but everything was explained clearly in the lectures. The reading and workload was manageable, but I didn't think the readings added much to the class. The subject matter was overall interesting.
I would've never learned anything about IPA had I not taken this class. Took it for a distro and was a pretty unique class to take in that regard. However, I would probably take an easy distro if I could go back and change this class. I find the grading in this class to be fairly skewed (HW is 30% of your grade, and there are only 6 HW assignments. Also, six 5-question quizzes make up 12% of your grade.) towards largely unimportant tasks that you can easily lose points on. Exams aren't that hard unless you study. This class has interesting subject material that you probably wouldn't learn about otherwise, but you should definitely take an easier distro if you want to save yourself effort.
I found the class interesting and not difficult to understand, but I can see how it would be more on the boring side if this isn't what you're interested in.
The course provided a very good introduction into Linguistics in an introductory as well as cross-disciplinary way.
Focused too much on things that could've been learned outside of class
This was a pretty chill class, and professor Cole is relatively relaxed. You can totally get away with not doing the readings, but I probably would have done a lot better if Iɽ done them. All in all, pretty good science distro, but you're better off just taking rocks for jocks
Fairly easy! Only homework are hard, but doesn't take that long if you go to class! No need to do the readings! EXAMS EASY
This class is a good distro. It is fairly straightforward material and not too difficult. The last few weeks of the course get a little more abstract than the first part of the course, but it is not too bad. The 2 midterms exams cover the material well. If you pay attention and take notes in class, you'll do fine. The second midterm is cumulative, so keep that in mind. Overall, I good class to take. The professor goes through some of the slides really quickly though, so make sure to be ready.
I took this class for a distribution requirement, and it was great!
It was a good sister. I learned more than I thought I would and it wasn't extremely difficult.
This class is okay. Professor Cole is clearly very passionate about the topic, but it's difficult when almost everyone in the class isn't a linguistics major. All assignments are fair and it's easy to get low A/high B if you pay attention in class. Don't have to do any of the readings!
TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! Material is easy to learn and the exams are straightforward. Teacher is very willing to help and is passionate about the material she is teaching.
I personally did not like the class. It was boring and it was a struggle coming to class. If you don't get the first half, you literally SCREWED for the second half of the course. The professor, however, had lots of energy so that was the highlight of the class.
This course required a lot of memorization, especially when it came time to learn the IPA. However, I learned a lot too. This isn't a hard class concept wise.
This course was interesting and engaging. There was slightly more homework than expected, but it helped me prepare for the quizzes and exams.
Some of the text readings were a bit hard to understand, but the lectures were very clear and informative and the homework assignments never felt like busy work and were actually sort of fun! The students were also able to contribute examples and answers during lectures, which made class time more engaging.

Comments
Very interesting class. I definitely learned a lot and the workload was never too bad. Homeworks once a week are not too much to deal with and the weekly quizzes are also not too bad if you study a bit. Lecturer was good, just be warned it is an easy class to fall asleep in if you have a short attention span.
Really hard class!! Not very interesting and very hard to do well. Don't take it unless you have some interest in the subject otherwise it's super boring
First half of the course was pretty boring; it got more interesting in the second half. If you show up and pay attention, you will probably get an A.
There is a decent amount of memorization needed for this course. I was interested in languages and this course was definitely interesting. However, it was very english centric and would mention other languages from time to time. Professor Bradlow is very passionate about the subject but the homeworks are annoying. The Ta's graded harshly and the class is an easy A˺- if you put in more than 5 hours before the test to memorize the material.
This course was pretty easy and interesting but the way that the homework and tests were graded were pretty nitpicky so you should probably go to office hours and or email the professors and TAs.
Good course for basics of phonetics and phonology, would recommend to anyone interested in linguistics
The workload outside of class isnt bad, but you do need to go to lecture to really understand the concepts and be ready for the exams.
I was really interested in Linguistics before taking this course and found it to be really stimulating.
I knew nothing about linguistics coming into this course. I felt like it gave me a good overview of the subject and was an enjoyable topic to learn about.
I really enjoyed this class. Like any linguistics class, it challenges you to think about language in a way you might not have before. The stuff you learn seems overwhelming at first, but they break it down pretty easily and the assignments aren't too difficult. There are group quizzes though, which is annoying, but okay. It does not seem as random˺rbitrary as semantics or syntax can be, which might be a bonus for someone looking for an interesting distro requirement that won't give them a headache
Super interesting course! Prof Bradlow does the best job I've seen at NU of filling a medium/large lecture class with hands-on learning. Weekly quizzes with a team element that can boost your grade, assignments, and in-class practica (that aren't stressful because they don't go toward your grade) make learning along the way easy so that when the exams come along you're already pretty prepared! Engaging material and great teaching.
Don’t worry about getting the textbook- Bradlow’s lecture slides provide a wealth of information and include everything that will be on exams. Super interesting class, but kinda boring towards the end.
The professor was very good and stimulated our interest in the subject, and I enjoyed the fact that this was a linguistics class but had some graphs/mathy stuff in there too
Linguistics is a subject I knew nothing about coming in. This class provided me with the resources to learn what felt like a whole new language, and I loved it! Bradlow really loves to teach this material so lectures are mostly engaging and interesting. The first half of the course comes really easily, but the second half is more abstract and requires some more thought.
This was a really fun and easy class. The interactive homeworks were pretty cool and the lectures were almost always pretty interesting
Bradlow is a master of the course. Complete control over every class, and a truly wonderful pace to the course.
It was a fair course. We had quizzes and homework almost every week but they were a nice way to remember the material and were not a lot of work.
do NOT take this as an easy distro. it's not easy.
heavy workload for a distro (a quiz a week you definitely need to study for, a homework a week, two big tests).
not intuitive, good amount of memorization and studying required.
interesting topic if you need this for your major, but don't take it just because.
Great class! However, deeper discussion on the reading/vocab material would’ve been helpful.
Good natural science distro if you don't want to do more physicsy or chemistry type courses, especially if you are interested in linguistics
The material was pretty interesting and I was looking forward to taking this class. However, it was hard to enjoy the course because most of the people in the class were only there as a distribution requirement, so as soon as they realized it would take even a little bit of work to get an A in the class, they complained a lot, which really made the course a lot more depressing. But if you go into it with a good mindset, its not a super hard course and it is actually really interesting! Professor Bradlow is also super wonderful and engaging!
Great class but at times very slow moving.
Boring course. First midterm is easy and just memorization. Second is a bit more challenging and very long. Don't need to go to class to do well -- homeworks are what can affect your grade.
This is a great class for a MST distro! Not super math or science heavy if you're not into that. It was fun, the homework was short worksheets, and quizzes weren't difficult.
This course was kind of difficult for a distro, but you definitely learn a lot. There is not a lot of homework but you need to study the slides between classes or it's hard to keep up.
I thought the pace of the class was very fast. I never really understood what was going on and had to teach myself the material. I also thought it was unfair how much weight the homework assignments held considering these are supposed to be practice and were often very long and challenging. Even if you do extremely well on the midterm and exam, you still won't end up with a good grade because of the homework.
Lot of memorization, but not too difficult. This class is definitely worth it if you are at all interested in linguistics-- a great distro. I learned a lot of new things that will stay with me forever and was constantly fascinated by the information being presented in class.
This class is super fun and easy. I personally love linguistics, though, so I'm biased.
The first half of the quarter is basically teaching you IPA, and the second half is random other topics.
It's a GREAT way to fulfill a natural science distro without competing with premeds.
You don't need to do any of the reading (or even buy the textbooks probably), since all the tested material is only from the lectures (sometimes contradicting other sources).
PLEASE TAKE THIS DISTRIBUTION CREDIT. This class is an incredibly east A. The averages on the midterm and final are over 90. The majority of the grade is determined by homework assignments. The workload in incredibly minor.
Interesting distro course with great instruction. Easy A as long as you do the homework.
Tha course was difficult. It required you to really pay attention to class and study every lecture for the quizzes and HW assignments you had each week. Additionally, the grading was picky.
I was not a fan of this class. I actually hated it. Only towards the end did I start to realize that it could’ve been interesting, but the format of the class and the teaching just made me dislike it. Class was always boring and it really is a lot of information to learn in a quarter. But it’s not all that hard if you study for the midterms and do well on the homework’s (which are kind of hard)
This course actually surprised how much material is covered and how much of it was new to me. Lectures can be dry sometimes, but I never regretted going to class cause it always helped with the quizzes.
This course was interesting and I learned a lot. It was a bit too dry though, and it needed a lot of memorization.
This course was fantastic. Professor Bradlow is a great teacher, and you can really tell how much she cares about the subject. A fantastic distro. I learned alot, and the tests are pretty straightforward. Not a ton of work outside of class time, and a very interesting subject. (You don't have to do any of the readings, just pay attention in lecture.)
Great class! not too difficult, pretty straightforward. exams are fair if you study beforehand. I recommend--- go for it, take this class.
Pretty interesting class. Homeworks were kind of annoying and unclear sometimes, but the group quizzes were nice. I had a pretty hard time staying focused in lecture even though I thought the material was pretty interesting. Exams were fairly easy even though the homeworks were always a wildcard. Overall Iɽ recommend this class as a science distro, it's pretty cool.
Great, great class. I took it purely for fun, because I always found linguistics and IPA etc interesting. Loved the material and found myself thinking about it all the time, mumbling random sounds to myself (which my roommate rather enjoyed). Professor Bradlow is great, and and she did a fantastic job making the course so engaging.
There is so much information in this course and the professor flew through the notes making it hard to learn in class.
Really easy, really interesting course! Course work consists of weekly homeworks and quizzes, as well as two exams. Iɽ always been interested in linguistics, but taking this course really pushed me to want to take more linguistics classes in the future!
The tests and homework are very doable, hardest part of the course is the weekly quizzes which you should spend some time to study for
Professor Bradlow CARES about this course, her content, and her students' ability to learn what she is so excited to share. She maintains a professional disposition, but occasionally slips into a more casual approach, even going so far as hidden memes within her slides. Take this course as a distro, or as anything else.
I loved 250-0! The subject was completely new to me, but the pace was good and the readings supplemented the lectures well so I didn't feel overwhelmed. 2 tests, one for each half of the course but the second one covers most of the quarter material. Learning the IPA is really interesting & generally makes language more interesting overall. Take the course, especially if you need the distro!
The lecture is not really important, as long as you read each slide carefully after class.
This course is fairly easy. All the lectures are posted on canvas and the tests aren't too hard at all. The homeworks are graded extremely harshly and the directions are often very vague. This class should be an easy A if you manage to do well on the homeworks
The lectures were not super interesting but it's clear Professor Bradlow is passionate. The little quizzes were frustrating because if you got more than one wrong, you failed but being able to bring up your score with a team score was helpful.
The course is basically like learning a new language. The powerpoints made it difficult to distinguish important information and I found it very hard to use PRAAT.
the weekly quizzes and homework force you to understand the material every week which is good, but you do need to understand what we learn in class and keep up with it

Comments
Overall, I didn't really enjoy this course. While I was eventually able to perform well on the midterm and final, I often felt that the lectures didn't prepare me enough for the quizzes and assignments; I often found it more helpful to google concepts than to refer to my notes. While I was eventually able to get everything down in time to study for the tests, I didn't perform well on the assignments and quizzes, and my grade suffered because of that.
I always try to keep an open mind regarding courses outside of my major, but I can honestly say this is one of the worst courses I've taken in the 3 years I've been in college. And not even necessarily in terms of the material, but in terms of the instruction. Language in general is so abstract and can get complicated, but it's only further convoluted when the concepts are not taught effectively. We moved through (complicated!) material in lectures far too quickly, and the sequence of topics did not feel organized whatsoever. I spent way too much time just teaching myself the material in this course outside of class because when we wouldn't finish slides, Prof Cole would just tell us to read it at home. On top of that, the homework never took me less than 2 hours to complete — and even when I did spend a lot of time on it, I sometimes didn't achieve any more clarity in the topic. You end up with a group of people to work with for this course, and all of us agreed that this class was really not enjoyable, and that the material, while interesting, was difficult to understand a lot of the time because of the instruction. Overall, it just felt like they crammed way too much material in each week, and it definitely showed. During the final exam, only about half of the material you see in the lecture slides actually make it onto the exam, so you end up studying for far longer than is necessary — time that could have been more effectively spent working on assignments for other courses.


Professor Cole is nice; don't get me wrong. However, I really was not a fan of the teaching style and the amount of work she asked of students. The course is likely great for students who are actually majoring in Linguistics and have had some experience in it, but for students who are just taking it as an "introductory" science distro, this did not feel introductory at all. The thing is, I liked the material and I did find it interesting, but I experienced so much frustration because it was taught so poorly. So all in all, if you're thinking of taking this course as a science distro that you've had no experience in and that you think youɽ enjoy, I highly, HIGHLY advise against doing so.
This is a decent course if you need a natural science distro. If you're good at rote memorization, it'll be easy because there is a lot of content to memorize. Don't get the textbook, almost all the quizzes are over material in the slides.
Textbook was not helpful. The powerpoints were all posted online so going to class wasn't that helpful. Homework was worth a surprisingly large part of the grade so those are pretty important.
Really liked this class. Pretty easy, not too much work but interesting material. Professor Cole was good.
I would avoid this class if you're looking for easy distros. Harder than 260 imo. Lots of homeworks which were graded harshly, several in class quizzes, 2 exams (midterm˿inal), and 2 projects. Still probably better than math for formal studies, but a brutal class nonetheless.
This is a requirement for any linguistics major/minor. I did this for the language allied field in neuroscience, and I actually really enjoyed taking the class. It is not an easy A but it is definitely possible to get A˺- with 1-4hrs/week of work. There's weekly homework assignments and quizzes. Low-key the quiz grades are important because it can push your grade from a B+ to an A-. There's only 2 exams which aren't bad. The TAs and Professor Cole are accommodating with grade concerns and confusing information. Also it's fine if you miss a few lectures.
I took this purely to fill a math/technology credit and I wouldn't necessarily recommend that if you're in the same boat. It's a lot of homework, quizzes, and projects to fill a requirement. The material can be really hard and confusing and the homework is not easy. It can be interesting and better than straight math, but keep in mind it's a lot of work.
This class was not awful, but definitely pretty boring. Fairly easy class, except some of the quizzes were pretty hard. Worth it for the natural science distro.
A few quizzes, a few homework's, 2 projects, and 2 exams. not a fun class, the textbook is awful and so are the lectures. only took it because I needed 1 more science distro. wasted so much time on this class
I took this to fulfill my math and science distro. Pretty tough for a distro class, but if you stick with it past the first couple weeks it gets easier.
I took this class for a distro and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVED IT. The trick is to put in the effort for the first two weeks by memorizing the IPA chart. After that, it's crazy easy and crazy interesting. I learned how to make a ton of sounds that don't occur in English but occur in other languages, like clicks and different kinds of ingressives and fricatives and plosives and all that. Really, really, really interesting class. The two exams were easy and the two projects took maybe an hour each. Highly recommend for an area 1 distro
A good break from intense McCormick courses but still learned a lot. Some of the homeworks and concepts are really wishy-washy though, so don't expect to be like a hard-science course. It was fairly interesting, sometimes tedious, depending on the topic. Weekly quizzes aren't too bad-- just make sure you memorize the lecture slides! All you need to do in this class in order to be successful is study the lecture slides. !!!Study the lecture slides!!! You just gotta memorize them. The homework isn't too bad either and it helps to solidify whatever you learned in class that week.
I think this course stretched my mind in ways that were good for a student who spends most of my time writing and reading. However, lectures were boring and not super engaging. The textbook was quite unhelpful even though they act like it is key.
This class is a challenge, but there was still a lot of compelling and intriguing material that was covered that made the course a bit more bearable. Learning the IPA symbols and interpreting the spectrographs and wavelengths were quite tricky at first but as long as you pay attention during lecture you should be okay.
This class does not cover the most interesting content, but Professor Cole does a great job communicating concepts and making things more interesting. The workload is very reasonable, and the two exams are very easy. The quizzes are most important for your grade, so be prepared for those. If you're thinking of this class for the distro, it's fairly easy and not too boring (we all use language, so it's relatable content). Professor Cole is also super helpful during office hours. Overall, a very reasonable intro course!
As with other linguistics classes, I was worried that it would be harder for someone like me whose first language isn't English, but if anything that enhanced parts of an already very enthralling course.
This a great course if you need the WCAS science distro and don't want to simply take earth. It's a bit more work but worth it.
Professor Cole is a great lecturer. Her homeworks were kinda hard and the quizzes kinda tricky but the misterms weren’t so bad
This class is not an easy A. There are lots of small things such as quizzes and homework that count towards your grade and it’s very easy to score low on them which brings your grade down. You need to learn th IPA chart early on. Don’t bother buying the book, everything is covered on the lecture slides.
Although I’m not super interested in Linguistics, I did find much of the material interesting, and Professor Cole really does care a lot about the subject. It’s not the most engaging class, but as long as you grasp what’s on the presentation slides well, you should be fine.
This course is an easy distro if you attend and pay some attention during lectures. The exams are simple and contain the exact material that would be expected.
I really enjoyed the course and learned a lot fo interesting new things. I'm very proud to know the IPA chart and hung it above my bed!
Recommend! Linguistics is fascinating and Professor Cole is super good at teaching this course. Lectures are dry and you don't really have to go to do well, but you should because the homeworks are super hard and confusing. Also, the weekly quizzes aren't as easy as you expect, so study in advance. Both exams were super doable, but you have to study a lot and it's not an Easy A. But if you study a lot and do well on the homework and other assignments, you will be very prepared!
This course is not an easy distro that you can spend less than 3 hours a week. The homework is super time-consuming. Overall, a hard A-
Jennifer Cole is like an ethereal goddess: I'm both scared of her and want to be her. The course material is really interesting and she's really excited to be teaching it, which is great. I wish weɽ done more. Sometimes the projects (which aren't hard) felt like busy work, and it felt unnecessary having a project due finals week in addition to the exam (which is the last day of class.)
This was a very interesting class for a distro requirement! The most important advice I can give is to commit the basic material to memory EARLY ON. Otherwise, you will struggle to understand later concepts, as the information builds on itself throughout the quarter. I did not find reading the textbook to be useful, but office hours with Professor Cole were always very helpful. The homework was the most aggravating part of the course because not much instruction was given and grading was a bit picky. Overall, good class!
I thought this course was interesting, albeit a bit dry at times. I took it as a core course for the cognitive science major and, while I wish I had taken a course about the meaning of words instead, I thought this course was actually taught really well. The material isn't that difficult, but you actually have to spend time with it if you want to do well in the course, which isn't hard to do.
Amazing introduction to the study of sound patterns :)
It was a fun distro, but I don’t think I will use the knowledge for anything useful in the future
Interesting content. A lot of work but worth it
this class was a great introductory class to linguistics. Professor Cole made it so that the information was easy to understand and she was very willing to spend time outside of class to help her students. Her midterms and homeworks were graded very fairly and the group components of the class added much educational value. Alas, I got a B-. YOLO.
If you're looking for an easier distro, do NOT take this class!!! There is a ridiculous amount of information and you are expected to know just about all of it. Homework is graded harshly and is difficult. The class moves at a rapid pace.
I enjoyed how the course content is relatively easy to understand, which then led to me spending less time trying to memorize material.
The material itself was not too bad as long as you kept up with the work. The readings were not necessary-only relevant for clarification. As long as you review the powerpoints you should be fine
This was a moderately challenging course. A huge amount of your grade is based on graded homework assignments. There are 2 projects, a midterm, and a final. The tests are fairly easy. Lectures are fairly boring, but most of the information overlaps with the readings. There is a quiz once per week, so you really only have to go to those classes.
I thought this course was fine overall, but not anything particularly exciting or engaging for me. I thought the instruction was sometimes dull and the alignment of the course textbook with the in class material was sometimes incongruous. I enjoyed doing more practical applications of this material, like in our projects and group work.
IPA seems daunting but it's really not that bad (especially since you only really need to commit the English IPA stuff to memory), overall course seemed really fair and I learned a surprising amount.
Good class, lots of memorization, go to class and work hard on the homeworks and you'll be fine
This class really helped me to apply and develop my critical thinking skills. IT WAS FUN!
At the beginning it seems like it is complicated and hard but if you put enough work and time it is actually an easy class. However, there are quizzes every week so be ready for them.
Interesting course and not difficult at all. The homework and studying for the quizzes can be annoying but aside from that is good and easy.

Comments
Great class! Nice review of topics covered in semantics (i.e. Grice, implicature) as well as other topics. Prof. Ward is an incredible professor; he often gets going on tangents, but those tangents are still somewhat relevant to the discussion and still interesting. Class only has a midterm as well as a final (or a research paper instead), and readings are interesting and not too time-consuming.
This class is very abstract and conceptual, so be prepared to speak your ideas and share questions˼omments. Prof Ward really likes to open discussion to the class, so there are days when the points in the lecture are not the main takeaway. For this reason it's really important to show up to class and be engaged in discussion
Professor Ward is wonderful. Highly recommend him as a professor. He is very passionate in teaching this course. He is very willing to help you if you feel like you're struggling. The material of the class can be a bit difficult if you know nothing of pragmatics, but Ward does a good job of simplifying difficult concepts. There is one take-home open-book midterm exam and then the option of a paper or another take-home exam for the final. That is the only coursework. I did none of the reading for the course and only used the book when I needed help on the exams. If you are a linguistics major or minor, this is a solid elective class.
engaging lectures, solid reading material, effective examinations
Before I took this course, pragmatics is a field of linguistics that I had the least confidence in as a non-native speaker. Nevertheless, Professor Ward really stimulated my interest in pragmatics by showing us the "artistic" side of language usage, and this class has easily been the most enjoyable class for me this quarter. I wish we had more time to cover all the course materials in no hurry, but that is simply unrealistic given the quarter system and the massive amount of exciting topics in pragmatics.

Comments
Professor Ward is a really good lecturer, and the subject matter of the course is really engaging if you're interested in meaning at all. The class is easy to follow, and the workload is very reasonable (readings and two take-home exams). The discussions we had in class sometimes brought us off topic a little but were always very interesting and usually brought something new and relevant to the table. I really enjoyed taking this class. Great choice for major and even non-majors interested in the topic.
Gregory is truly wonderful in class. So incredible knowledgeable and conversational
This a GREAT class. By far one of the most interesting linguistics classes out there in terms of the material. Prof Ward is very effective and engaging lecturer. He is very passionate about the subject, so listening to the lectures was actually quite fun. The format of the class was really nice, no tedious problem sets! Take home exams were fair and manageable. Take this class :-)
Class is mostly lecture based with a lot of questions. It's based off the readings. Make sure you do the readings because the midterm and final are both take home and require you to fully understand the readings.
This is my favorite section of Linguistics! This class only has 2 midterms and participation, which is good for not having a lot of homework but a little nervewracking since the assignments count for so much and you don't get any feedback on participation. Ward is an entertaining professor who encourages students to ask questions and to meet with him. Sometimes, though, he can be the stereotypical tenured professor who uses his job to push his political views even when they have nothing to do with the topic.
This is one of my favorite linguistics courses so far. Ward is very passionate about the material and makes every lecture interesting. The material is easily applicable to your everyday conversations, so it's not at all hard to understand. Midterm, Final, class participation.

Comments
easy distro!! just a midterm and final.
Not very challenging but the lectures can be boring.
Definitely an interesting class. I have learned to look at a culture and its language from another perspective.
This course is a great distribution requirement - as long as you get 100% on the quizzes and don't miss a study day, you don't really have to attend class. The questions on the tests are given beforehand on a study guide, so as long as you know the content on there, you'll be absolutely fine.
This class was a good distro. It did not require a lot of work and it isn’t too hard to get an A. I personally did not find the material to be very interesting because it is all about the history, culture, and language of the Balkans. But considering the amount of work the class requires, it was a good class to take for a distro.
This course taught me a lot about a subject I was not at all familiar in, but it could get very dry at times.
Class was definitely not my type as I am not the greatest reader. There was a lot of reading, but on the most part they're only necessary for the 8 online quizzes throughout the quarter. You are allowed to drop 3 of those quizzes. The midterm and final you are given a study guide. That makes it easier to prepare for the tests, but you still have to prepare. Class is rather boring but there are group work days where attendance is checked for points.
waste of my time, cant believe this class cost me 4000 dollars in tuition fee. absolute trash
Great class for a history distro. The teacher is amazing and has a great interest in the subject. Weekly quizzes aren't very difficult, and exams require just a moderate amount of essay and short response preparation.
The class is one of those classes where it's easy to get a B+˺-, but relatively challenging to get an A. You have to go to class as there are random days where attendance is take. Online quizzes are really easy and she gives you the exact questions you will get on the exam.
Okay do NOT take this class if you are wanting a good history distro. This is WAY more of a linguistics class than anything else. Also people might say its an easy A but the material is so boring and lectures are so disorganized that its really hard to have any interest in the subject to begin with, and much harder to study for. Iɽ say its an easy B+. Also Professor Elliott is was better to talk to in person... its very hard to follow her in class and her slides are equally as bad. If you need help throughout the quarter, definitely just go straight to her in office hours and avoid referring to the slides or TAs who were sooo unhelpful - and there were 3 of them!!
Not a lot of time required. weekly quizzes that are easy if you do the readings. she gives midterm and final questions out before hand so easy to prepare.
Super boring but also super easy ethics and values distro as long as you prepare for the midterm and final
very manageable class. just study from the slides and know a few concrete examples of things and you'll be good. you dont really need to go to lecture but still do cuz theres pop-group work that is worth a decent amount.
Ideal distro. Easy and not a lot of work but very interesting.
Straightforward distro. Pretty much no time was spent on it outside of class with the exception of weekly quizzes which do require you to do the readings. For the midterm and final you get the essay prompts beforehand, so as long as you prepare them you will do well.
This class requires minimal effort beyond preparing for a midterm and final, and a short paper. Just a lot of brute memorization.
Lectures were sometimes interesting but usually very dry.
Great course for your ethics and values distro
hey
Interesting, if you pay close attention and do all the readings. The course was not that difficult, great distro class if you're looking for a decent grade.
Terrific class, Professor Elliot is great with students and excited about content. Definitely take this course.
This class was amazing. Very easy A. Professor was really nice. Grading was simple as long as you show up you get the participation points. Only a few online quizzes based on the reading (you get to drop like 3˸), a biography which everyone gets 100 on, and the midterm and final which she gives you the questions too in advance. Take this class if you want a very easy class that is actually really interesting as well.
This is a fantastic course! The subject matter is very interesting over a region not many people know much about. Professor Elliott, however, is the best part.
Pretty easy course. Easy A. Go to lecture and youll be fine
This class was not very difficult. The subject is pretty interesting and the readings are pretty good but the lectures were a little dry and somewhat boring.
I loved the Prof and I learned so much about this region. Quizzes drove me insane sometimes and the in class group work was frustrating because most of the students have incentive to free-ride off of other students. Grading was fair and work was minimal. Good distro.
This is an easy distro, but I would not say the content was very gripping. Professor Elliot is a great person and is really interested in the subject, but I personally did not fall in love with linguistics. Great if you are a linguistics major though.
Great distro. If you're capable of memorizing, you'll do very well on the midterm and final.
It was a decent course. I personally had no interest in it, but its a fine distro.
great class. TAs can be harsh. Pray for an easy one.
Great course!
easy distro but not interesting
It was a very easy course and taught me about a new subject matter. However, instruction was relatively jumbled.
2 exams. Study guides Identical to exams so just complete and memorize study guides to do well. 1 biography of classmate everyone does well. And random group work with mandatory attendance. Easy class
This class is so easy. Elliot is very enthusiastic and nice, but her lectures are not necessary to do well in class at all. There is only one two page essay, one midterm and one final, both in which the study guide is basically the exam. Definitely take this course if you want an easy and fairly interesting distro.
Easy class. While the group activities during the lecture were tedious and the final exam should have been a final paper, the course material was relatively interesting. Take this class if you want an easy distro
easy distro!! elliot is really good at making this course interesting and she can be really accommodating for students, there is a light workload and pseudo take home exams
Easy distro, boring information. The readings are so long, but you don't necessarily have to do them.
Manageable distro! Some people skip class, but I found the lectures interesting. It's a huge class so you can work on your ling HW during lecture. I would definitely recommend this distro because it's not too challenging but engaging enough to be a solid class.
Fascinating. Not too much work, heavy weighting on exams. Go to class or do readings
Easy A˺- for an ethics distro, but not a very good one. Go to class right after the exam - attendance is taken, which really felt like an unfair dig at students who were busy during midterms week. The class tries to cover too many topics in too short of a time and becomes very confusing, but luckily the midterm˿inal exam review sheets tell you what you need to know.
Easiest class I have taken in academia. Including elementary school.
Pretty Easy distro. I feel like I learned a bit about the Balkans and the people who live there. Lectures could be a little dry, but ultimately the class is pretty fair.
good ethics distro
It was fairly easy and interesting would rte 9⼐
Yeah so if you're looking for a class to completely just chill in, this is it. Don't have to go to lectures, she gives study guides before every midterm and final so you literally just have to memorize those and you'll be fine for the tests. The content is interesting and really easy A (assuming you look at the study guides).
I was very disappointed with this course. I thought I was going to learn much more about the Balkans themselves but I honestly feel like I left knowing nothing about the actual region and just the linguistic history. The course material was just not engaging whatsoever but class is required because of the group work so Iɽ really recommend not skipping. You don't really need to do the reading except for the online quizzes which are pretty straightforward, the tests are mostly on the lectures and then you can refer back to specific readings. There is also a linguistic˾thnic biography which almost everyone gets an 100 on, and group work attendance goes into your grade. The one great thing about this class was that the midterm and final are in class but you get the questions beforehand so you know what to expect. However, I felt like the midterm was graded very subjectively and I got points off for things that I didn't know I was expected to write down even though I answered the question as they asked for it. I was told to come to the review session for the final and ask to go over the short answers so that I would know exactly what to write. But because of the gun scare that day, the review session was cancelled, which is totally understandable- however, TAs should have been available to answer questions via email or the review session should have been postponed. Yet the TAs did not answer emails for the rest of the day or the next day (when the early optional final was) which was very unprofessional and not fair. That being said, Professor Elliott is super nice and seems like she cares about her students. I just wish this class was more organized and engaging. Honestly, everyone says this class is easy but since it was so disorganized and dry I would honestly just recommend taking a different class that is more interesting even if it is harder, you'll probably get more out of it and have an easier time studying if you find the topic engaging.
Course is very well organized and the instructor helps the students to be prepared for exams by providing study guides.
Very manageable workload
TAKE THE EXAMS SERIOUSLY. The class is pretty laid back and the readings aren't hard to process but definitely study for the exams and make sure you have everything ready for the exams.
nice distro. memorize and regurgitate and you'll be fine
super easy distro. Can get really boring so just come prepared with stuff to do during lecture.
Good for a distro. Would not recommend for fun.
Overall, Professor is very knowledgable and taking this course is a good option for those who are seeking to clear a distribution requirement or otherwise check out the field of linguistics
I know other CTECs say this class is an easy A, but it only can be easy if you're either genuinely interested in the Balkans or if you're good at memorization. It helps that she gives you topics and essay prompts that will be on the midterm and final beforehand, because otherwise it would definitely be too much course content to have to know. It takes a decent amount of time to prepare for both exams but its definitely worth it. An A is attainable if you put in the work to cram for both. Readings along the way are necessary due to canvas quizzes, which is helpful when trying to think of textual evidence for your essay responses on tests.
I wanted a class that was manageable and interesting. I wanted a class that wasn't overwhelming with a professor who was kind. This class met all of those criteria and helped me gain a newfound appreciation for the Balkans as well.
Great course, great distro! Fairly easy and very interesting! You will walk away from this class a better person because you will have a better understanding of how language informs our perceptions of others. You will have a better understanding of how language influences your sense of self and your sense of belonging to an ethnicity or nation.
The readings for the course were not very dense; they were fairly easy to understand. The professor sums up the main points in the lecture slides pretty well. The linguistic concepts are easy, anyway. If you're someone who is unfamiliar with the Balkans like me, the tricky part might be learning the history and geography of the region, but the Professor Elliot and the TAs do a good job of breaking it down for you. 
There are weekly reading quizzes on Canvas but they are super easy and short, and the professor drops your three lowest scores. There are also random group assignments during lecture in which they take attendance, but don't let that deter you from taking this class. Boo hoo, go to lecture.
I would definitely take this class if you're looking for a good Ethics and Values distro. Professor Elliot is approachable, clear in her lectures, and simply a joy to learn from.
Super great distro. Highly recommend
This course is deceptively difficult.
This is a solid distro. The midterm and final are super straightforward. Prof Elliott is an engaging prof who sometimes talks about things not related to the Balkans, but who really makes it easy to succeed if you put in the time and work
This class is pure memorization. Pretty easily graded and a great way to get an Ethics or History Distro out of the way. The material is super boring and I feel like there was no use in learning the material we did. That being said, with only 2 nights required of studying for the midterm and final this class is worth taking for the A.
Professor Elliott is a kind person, but is a boring lecturer. I was originally excited for this class, but after each progressive lecture it became a struggle to go to class even (most people did not towards the end). It's an easy class though, just be prepared for some work/memorization/reading of course
do not take this as a distro, there are much more interesting ones that don't require you to memorize 20 pages of facts for the exams
Interestingish material but lectures are very boring
If you are interested in any aspect of the course title, then you would like this class. If you are looking to fulfill a distro, this class will be pretty boring for you.
This course is exactly what you expect: an introductory survey class based off of memorization and fulfilling a Weinberg distribution requirement. As such, despite others' evaluations, actual work IS required. An easy class at Northwestern means that you are evaluated based on what you remember rather than critical analysis. Doing the readings are still necessary to some extent - judge for yourself what will help you know the material best for the test. Some material is not discussed in lecture and is solely from the readings, so take that as you will. There is no way of knowing where you stand in your participation grade, though I suspect it is based off of lecture attendance with effort in group work. I did not find this class too interesting, though I was forced to take this through Weinberg so if you are interested in linguistics or the history of Eastern Europe I expect you would enjoy this course! I did leave with a better understanding of ethnic and linguistic conflict in the Balkans.
Very interesting topics
easy class take it. Readings can be long at times.
History Distro. Enjoy.
Pretty easy class. Just make sure to do good on the quizzes and read (not really necessary though).
This course was interesting in explaining why things are the way they are in the Balkans but if you really want to take this class, there is like a lot of material to cover
This is great course for an ethics/values distro (or a history distro if you take Slavic 255, which is the same class, shared section). Professor Elliot's a great lecturer, and provides all the powerpoints online. She even makes study guides with all the material that you need to know for the midterm and the final. This class is an easy A if you simply go to lecture and do everything on the study guide.
This class depends solely on TA grading. You get the questions to exams ahead of time so you can prepare. There is a lot of reading, but it is not super necessary to read it all. There is group work on the readings, but it is chill.
Readings don't really help with your understanding of the course. Make sure to attend group work days as participation goes a long way. Exams not too bad.
Good class. Lectures are a bit long and dry but Elliott is a great professor who is wiling to help. Picking a good group for the group work activities helps immensely, otherwise there will be a few people shouldering most of the work.
learned a lot about Balkans
You can take a different ethics distro, get a better grade, and actually learn something from it. This class isn't worth it.
I didn't know anything about the Balkans prior to this class, and know I can have a proper conversation about it. Also, Prof. Elliott managed to convey her ideas in a very didatic way. It is a lot of content to cover, but she did a great job in choosing readings that went straight to the point and although the lectures were not essential (except by the fact she usually took attendance), they were always very interesting.

Comments
I like him as a professor. Only take this class with friends though or you'll fail.
It is far more difficult than you might think
For a distribution requirement, I highly recommend taking this class (as long as it's with Clark). Big perks of no in-class exams, and problemsets you can collaborate with friends on, so really the most challenging part is getting to class every day as attendance is a key part of the grade. But other than that, it's definitely a class that you can take as a distro and not be disappointed at the end of the day.
This course feels a little disjointed at times - I often felt like I was missing the overall point of the course, but I did learn some specific things about language which was cool! Brady's dope and his tattoos are so beautiful.
This course isn't too time-intensive, and it is a great non-math formal studies option. HOWEVER, the problem sets are graded harshly and you will get tired of the "this is the part fo the course where people hate me" jokes after they are "uttered" for the nth time.
As a person with a background in linguistics, let me say that this course was tough. The slides are confusing, the problem sets are difficult, and although Professor Clark is easy on the eyes, I dreaded having to go to class.
I really enjoyed this class. The reading, lectures and homework were all very clear and purposeful -- no busywork -- and it was easy to learn. Brady is a great professor; he's funny and easygoing while also being thoughtful and smart. The class is a combination of theory and more number-based stuff, but it's a good balance, and they complement each other well. Basically would highly recommend this class. I took it as a distro but also was already interested in languages/linguistics, and I had a great time.
I was kinda disappointed in this course because the content just seemed so convoluted and needlessly complicated.
Brady was a great teacher! His sense of humor brightens up my day and his explanations are pretty clear. He's also really nice and helps you out if you need it. Take this class with him. There's just weekly assignments that aren't too bad, and take home finals and midterms. The second half of the class is slightly harder than the first but there isn't really a reason to do bad in this class.
This quotes teaches you to evaluate the truth values of sentences and shows you different ways to use that information to learn more about the information given to us by the sentence
DONT TAKE THIS CLASS FOR A DISTRO. People will tell you this class is boring; it is, but it's so much worse than that too. I took it with four friends and we all agreed we would've been better off just taking math or stats. Brady is a horrible lecturer with horrible lecture slides. Nothing is explained, nothing is clear, nothing is labelled. The saving grace of this class was that collaboration on homework was "encouraged," and I would've failed out in a hot second if I hadn't been able to do the homework with my friends every week. NOT WORTH IT. DONT DO IT.
I took this class for my formal studies distro and though it was not an easy class, I think I enjoyed this more than I would had I taken a regular math class. I really enjoyed learning more about language and structures, even though it gave me a headache basically every single time I walked in.
The professor was really good at making the subject seem relevant and interesting when many people were confused, getting everyone interested.
The course itself isn't too hard but sometimes the pace is very fast and some concepts are not explained in detail when they are first introduced. I wish the notes had more information on them and more examples.
This class is hard. Full stop. It's abstract, and a lot of the material is sort of up for interpretation. However, it will make you so much more aware of your own use of language, and a lot of the material is enlightening and relevant to everyday life. If you're the type of person who likes to solve puzzles, youɽ probably do well in this class. If you like your information cut-and-dry, you'll find it extremely difficult.
hardest concepts of the 3 ling cores courses, but not as much work as 250
can get away with not doing readings if you pay attention in class
difficult weekly problem sets, but tests are take-home
brady clark is my favorite man to grace this planet but his lecture style is disorganized
Ling 270 was a really interesting course but also pretty challenging. The material was all brand new stuff so having to learn it enough to use on a test or problem set was a challenge. Still, super cool and conceptual way of looking at language. Weekly problem sets & 2 take home exams.
This is a great introductory course. Brady keeps his lectures engaging, and the material is challenging but easily manageable. I would definitely recommend this course.
Good class
It is important to make sure to read the material in order to understand what is happening during class. There are class activities and discussions that you need to read the material. This can be a challenging class if you do not attend class because there are weekly problem sets due.
Class itself is what you make of it -- if you're interested in the material you'll probably enjoy it. Despite only taking it for a distribution requirement/not having much interest in the course, I enjoyed it because I loved Professor Clark! He's a great professor that also is cognizant of the fact that many of the students are just there for a requirement and is good at gauging where the class is. He's a really interesting and witty guy that makes the class cool.
For a Formal Studies distro, it's better than a math class, but don't expect smooth sailing if logic isn't your thing. It alternates between relatively fun common sense work and ridiculously frustrating pseudo-math. May not be what you expect from a linguistics course, especially about meaning.
This is a good course for a distribution requirement. The professor is funny and accessible. The problem sets are not too bad although they got kind of confusing in some parts of the course. Overall good class.
This was a very well run course. Difficult at times for sure, but it is clear that Professor Clark wants you to succeed. He makes great slides, gives great lectures, and is also very funny.

Comments
It was very interesting and a good course. It was quite difficult, though. Readings and office hours helped a lot.
This course was very challenging, but not impossible to pass.
This class was actually really cool and interesting, I wasn't really expecting it to be so logic/math based but that wasn't a bad thing. The class was this weird overlap between math, linguistics and philosophy, and was really cool. The weekly problem sets took an hour or two but manageable. The readings weren't mandatory but some of them were helpful on the problem sets since some of the questions were taken from them. The take home exams were hard and took a long time so don't put them off until the last minute and go to office hours.
This was a great class. Professor Potter was fantastic. Interesting material. Fair homework assignments and take home tests. Readings were not necessary but were helpful if you missed something in class or needed further clarification.
I enjoyed learning about the mechanics of communication but linguistics appears to me as a very inaccessible academic field.
It was a good class that was pretty challenging but he was very willing to help you learn if you were willing to put in the work and go into office hours. Definitely harder than I thought itɽ be but his grading system helps a lot.
The lectures are more helpful than the readings so you can probably get by without doing the readings if you attend class. Office hours are also extremely helpful in doing the homework assignments (they get progressively harder). Honestly this course wasn't what I expected, but it's a decent formal studies distro.
Do not take this course if you are looking for an easy formal studies distro. This is unnecessarily confusing and the problem sets and take home exams are difficult. Potter is cool but this class made me miserable.
This is an interesting class, and I would recommend it as a formal studies distro if you're really not a math person. It was more challenging than I expected - try to take it with a friend so that you can work together on the homeworks. Grades are determined by a problem set per week, and then a take-home midterm and take-home final. The fact that everything was take-home is really helpful since you could look through your notes for all of them, but it's still hard. Some of the readings didn't seem completely related to what we learned in the course, and a few made things more confusing. Professor Potter is pretty relaxed during lectures and makes things fun for the class.
Great course! Highly recommend taking it. The homework sets sometimes took a long time but were very manageable.
Harder than I thought but still very interesting. I didn't really know what to expect from that class but I was pleased to see that all the lectures were interesting. Sometimes the content of the class is a bit confusing but the powerpoints help a lot.
DO NOT LET CTECS FOOL YOU. THIS CLASS IS HARD. However, it is extremely interesting. Expect problem sets to take a good chunk of time, but Potter is more than willing to work with you during his office hours. Let me repeat: GO TO OFFICE HOURS. Midterms are graded harshly.
This was a pretty good class and not too time consuming outside of class
This was not that bad of a class. Some of the material was slightly challenging, but the professor worked on us with things we didn't understand. He was very approachable and the course made me think differently about how I use language, in both English and in my language major. Overall, not too mathematical (some set theory and logic is as technical as it gets) and not too intensive. Perfect distro.
This is a solid course and the way the grading works if you do your work and pay attention in class, you'll learn a lot and do well! If you're looking for a distro you'll learn from that's not super math-heavy, this is a great choice!
I enjoyed taking this course because the material was presented in a clear way and the professor was always willing to answer questions. At times, I was somewhat uninterested in the topic and the class can be confusing at times, but overall I enjoyed the course.
David really made Meaning interesting. The lectures sometimes did feel kind of long though, but I genuinely enjoyed the class and the material.
do. not. take. this. class. potter is not a good professor (although he's a great guy) but the material is so dry that I don't think anyone could do this material justice. i was so excited about linguistics but this definitely ruined linguistics for me.
I️ loved this class! I️ knew nothing about linguistics but learned so much.
Do not take this class as an easy science category distro for comm or whatever distro it is for weinberg. It is not easy. It requires work and time and effort for a very average grade. DO NOT TAKE THIS FOR AN EASY A. Also the material is weird and like irrelevant to anything in life. The professor also is kinda annoying.
This course requires a lot of learning if you are not familiar with linguistics and semantics as I was not. The midterm and the final, even though they are take-home, are incredibly hard. They are take-home for a reason, and even the extra time to do them does not help. There are weekly problem sets that aren't that bad because you can ask friends for help. A study group is necessary if you aren't confident in this subject.
fun and interesting course
This is a fine linguistics class. Potter is a good teacher but the subject is pretty dry
Professor Potter is a very charming instructor and always willing to spend more time on topics not understood and answer questions. The class is very straightforward and assignments just require you to spend time on them and sometimes do the readings. He explains things very well. Sometimes I wish we had more space to discuss about the philosophical interpretation and significance of the work we did in class as I was genuinely interested in the topic but sometimes the class felt to practical and we would not often take a moment to discuss what things really meant in the real world and how these abstractions helped us understand this.
This class made me think more about how the structure of what I say influences what people think I mean... like that sentence, class could sometimes be confusing until you thought about it a lot. I could easily skip the readings and I was glad that Prof. Potter let classmates collaborate on the problem sets. Prof. Potter gave fun examples from pop culture, and was much easier to understand in office hours than in class itself at times. Not necessarily an easy distro, and some class topics were far more relevant to real English usage than others, but if you like language and are willing to go to office hours, take this class - and take it with your friends so they can help you!
A lot of qwoprk, more than I expected but the grading system is really good so its an easy B+ if you put the work in.
I didn't enjoy this course. It could've been so much better but grades were never put in, so I had no concept of how I was doing in the class. It might've been better with a different instructor, but mine was just not very helpful. I felt rushed by other students and the professor when I went to office hours for help. Overall, I wish I had taken a different class for my distro requirement.

Shayne is super smart and eloquent. Concepts were challenging at times but everything was explained in a very concise and efficient manner. Requires a bit of work but you will learn a lot.
This is a great class if you specifically want to learn about upper-level experimental syntax and sentence processing! If you're not that interested in this area, I wouldn't recommend it...
This course helped to expand my knowledge on a lot of experimental topics. It was very useful for my own research, and helped me practice a lot of skills that I will need in grad school. I really enjoyed it!

Comments
I really enjoyed this class! I found the readings very interesting, and the more sociological focus allowed us to explore some interesting aspects of language use that aren't discussed as much in other classes, such as how tone is conveyed over the internet or how language from one speech community might be appropriated by another.
Best course I've ever taken at Northwestern
It was really interesting and held my attention well.
This course is nicely paced, intellectually stimulating, and should be taken by anyone with an interest in sociology or linguistics.
Really good class even though I thought it was pretty hard to wrap my head around the material, although that's probably just a personal weakness of mine. Professor D'Onofrio is super nice and facilitates really good class discussions that helped me learn a lot, and assignments are graded fairly with good explanations so you can improve on subsequent papers and such.
Annette was great- a conscientious, enthusiastic, knowledgeable professor. As a non-major, I struggled to enjoy the course material itself, which seemed like an infinite loop of denouncing language prescriptivism while noting that social constructs (like language stereotypes or hierarchies) are still important per se. This class wasn't hard, just felt opaquely academified at times and Iɽ caution non-majors who don't have a pre-existing passion for sociolinguistics. A welcome change might be focusing on 'practical applications' of sociolinguistics throughout the course to soothe social inequalities, instead of what felt like just the last class.
I am very grateful to have taken this course with Dr. D'Onofrio, as it has prepared me to enter the field with the abilities to interpret existing work and engage in discussion within the field.
Really great class!!! The subject is really interesting and accessible to everyone, not just linguistics majors. The content is compelling and presented very effectively. Professor Donofrio is also super nice and helpful. If you go to her during office hours, she will talk through anything with you and help you with whatever you need! She's really good at facilitating discussions in class and using the canvas posts to bring up or add to different topics. Loved this class!!! Take it if you're interested at all in social justice, language, identity, etc. You get to really explore that stuff in whatever way you want.
Prof Donofrio is by far one of the best in the Ling department. She is a great lecturer and very passionate about the subject. The class itself was really interesting and oftentimes really fun. The readings could be dense and dull at times, and they might be challenging to get through for those without a linguistics background. Overall a great class!
There was a lot of reading that was hard to skim over. If you've never taken any linguistics course before, LING 320 will be definitely challenging, like it was for me, bur not impossible. I liked Annette and the students were all very enthusiastic and active and it was a really stimulating class.

Comments
Both instructors are very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject, and conveyed that in class. Of course, being the first time this class was taught, there were a few kinks in it that I'm sure will be fixed for the second time the class is taught. There were a few skills that we briefly covered in class, like Praat scripting, that I wish we would have spent more time on, and some that we did not get to cover that would have been nice to, like running basic statistics on some of the data. Overall, it was a good course that with minor adjustments will be a great course.
It was clear that Matt and Jennifer were both very invested in this course and in giving students autonomy to develop and run their own research project. The readings we did for this class were interesting and gave students a taste of the types of projects that can be run with big data methods. I do wish we had spent more time discussing the readings rather than taking quizzes, which felt a little pedantic and meant that our understanding of the readings was not as deep as it could have been. I also really appreciated having the opportunity to modify some Praat scripts, which is a very useful skill, and would have loved to have more experience and practice with Praat scripting.

While I understand this could not have been foreseen since it was the first time this course was offered, we spent 4 class periods choosing a topic for the final project, which left us with just two weeks to actually implement it. This led to undue stress and meant that we were scrambling to create data visualizations of the results at the end of the quarter, which could have been avoided with a faster topic selection process.

Finally, despite being offered for both graduate and undergraduate students, it felt as though this class was targeted at undergraduates. By virtue of being a graduate student, I was not allowed to use the computer (be the "driver") in my pairs for much of the first half of the course, which limited my ability to gain firsthand experience in a software program that was new to me (Tableau) or learn skills that are actually likely to be valuable to my future research (Praat scripting). It was hard to balance my own learning needs with trying to allow undergrads to have a valuable learning experience as well. At one point in the quarter, graduate students were offered up as resources to be e-mailed over a weekend for help on a homework assignment, which felt unfair given that we were trying to complete the same assignment.
It was obvious that both instructors were kind of making it up as they went along, which made for a very haphazard experience. In particular, the instructors seem to have poor understanding of group dynamics. Often we were put into teams where one grad student was "in charge" of an undergraduate; this made for a very unequal learning experience. A common complaint among the grad students was that they didn't feel confident working in Tableau because they hadn't had enough practice. Twice, I was put in charge of a larger group and given a task that was impossible to accomplish during the time allotted (yet crucial to the final project). Of course, at the time, I didn't realize that these tasks were impossible; they were given to me by instructors I trusted, so we must have been capable of accomplishing them. When we could not, I felt like it was a reflection on my leadership skills—since I had been the leader, it must have been my personal fault that the team had failed. This has discouraged me from taking on further leadership roles in the future, outside of this class.
While I have several critical points where I was not satisfied with this class, I appreciate the passion and intentions from Professors Goldrick and Cole. I am also keeping in mind that this is the first time that this class has been taught. However, my concerns with the structure of class time, assignments, and computer programs lead me to believe that this class did not help me engage with existing big data sound research, nor did it equip me to confidently work with large sets of data.
This course was very experimental, and I felt like I was often left on my own as to how to understand a linguistic concept. The instruction on how to use Tableau was better, and I think it was a really cool tool to use that didn't require anyone to have lots of statistics or programming knowledge. The idea of creating our own experiment was also really cool, but we had such little time that it was executed really poorly. I think that if we had met more often or started earlier it could have been great.
This class was really interesting! Working with Tableau was very fun and the class was set up in a good way to gain hands-on experience with the program. Sometimes assignments were vague and difficult to navigate, but overall not too bad. The experiment part of the class was a cool way to apply the knowledge we gained. Non-linguistics majors would probably struggle a bit in this class. It's a good idea to have a solid background in phonology (take Ling 250 at least) before taking this class.
This course title may attract students that have a interest or background in both sound structure and data science. The wide breadth of topics covered and the lack of prerequisites may leave students with more developed knowledge of either of these topics wanting. The highly structured nature of the assignments and coursework may frustrate students who are able to come up with their own approaches to problems. Students without much of a background in computation or data science may still be well served by this course.
