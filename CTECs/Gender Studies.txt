Comments
Prof. Davis shows lots of enthusiasm for what he teaches in this class, which influences the rest of the class as a whole. He properly preps students in filmography terms that are initially unfamiliar to us all and also encourages us to provide any sort of perspective of the films watched as assignments during class. I definitely would recommend taking a class with Professor Davis to any student interested in watching films!
This was an interesting course, looking at gender and sexuality and cinematography. I learned a lot about looking at a film beyond the plot and storyline. Also just learning about how the filmmaking plays into the storyline.
I really enjoyed this class. The movies were interesting to watch and then hear more about in class.
i loved this class. it made me think so different about the themes of gender and sexuality and also about how to watch films in general. take this class if you want to really improve your writing and have it be assessed by a professor who really gives amazing feedback and suggestions. he was a great person and professor
This course was great! Professor Davis is a funny (if a bit awkward - in a good way), engaging, and excited professor who will meet his students where they are at in terms of background knowledge. Some of the films were a bit long, but overall the workload was not intense, and Professor Davis provided great feedback on every assignment.
I really enjoyed the course. The teacher was great. The way he incorparated certain thoughts about movies were great. It was an open and fun course and i loves it.
This was a super cool seminar. Professor Davis choose cool movies to watch and discuss and brought in relevant and interesting guest speakers.
Good class that helped me learn a lot about movies and there was a lot of freedom to pick what movie you wanted to write about for your papers. The professor was also very helpful with explaining what he wanted to see in his papers.
The course was very interesting, we watched movies that focused on the theme of the seminar, gender and sexuality. Some were more popular like moonlight and lady bird but others were something I probably would never have seen if not for this class. Class time consisted of discussing the movies and close scene analysis. You have to watch at least one, if not, two movies a week.
Nick Davis is a phenomenal teacher. He truly cares about his students, offers valuable feedback, and organizes each lesson so that its an immersing experience for every student. Best teacher I've had at NU so far. This class is a decent amount of work (one/ two films every week and some writing assignments) but its worth it!!! IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING TAKING THIS COURSE/ ANY COURSE WITH DAVIS DO IT. I had no experience with analyzing films-I hardly even watched films- and I was pretty okay at writing, but this course has helped me gain so much.
Great selection of films, Professor Davis is a great facilitator of discussion and provides really interesting background information for the films as well. And the papers were fairly interesting to write.
Professor Davis seems to care and genuinely be interested in his students. However it gets to the point where participating in discussion becomes uncomfortable. He won't let people freely talk without going on a long response, commenting about what the person just said. I think he has good intentions but it makes class seem unnatural to participate in. Movies were interesting but he said he was going to focus a lot on masculinity since apparently NU students don't get offered that many classes. I think I would prefer him to start a different class on that topic because most of us hadn't taken a gender class before so I felt like he was taking other people's ideas and putting it on first year students. Rather I would've like a greater survey of movies. We didn't get to movies about women until later in the class. Overall it's a good class if you're interested in analyzing films, not just watching them for fun.

Comments
I cannot stress how much I loved this course. The material was extremely interesting and really pertinent to issues that still exist today. The workload was definitely manageable, and the readings were enjoyable so it didn't always feel like work. This is a really good course as a freshman seminar, as it eases you into what taking humanities classes at Northwestern is like. The papers were all extremely manageable (3 papers 3-5 pages, one final paper) and the ability to rewrite them makes you a better writer. Dr. Partridge truly cares about the material she teaches and truly cares about how her students feel in her class.
The most important part of this course was actually attending the seminars--the discussions were really helpful and beneficial to learning about the course content. The readings were really bulky, so don't fall behind on them.
I think something very important for this course is to keep up with the readings because there is a lot, and if you fall behind, it's hard to contribute to discussions. Amy's discussions are pretty engaging and did change how I viewed women's health and feminism in general.
Very long lectures- would think this class is somewhat discussion centered because of the small amount of people in it, but hardly ever were there times to discuss ideas (even the readings) with others. Not only did the class not discuss the readings but a lot of the readings were never brought up even by Amy. Was kind of frustrating considering the extensiveness of some of the readings you have to do. Overall Amy is very nice and helpful if you go to her, but in class can sort of drag by because tangents occur every single class. Amy is incredible though and was very supportive and helpful for the transition into college!
Overall, this is an interesting course, however, I do not feel like I learned as much about the women's health movement as I would have liked to, as often times, the content of this course was mostly geared towards fitting a specific feminist narrative, rather than considering all perspectives involved. Its an interesting topic, but is taught only looking at the feminist perspective, without actually considering the practicality of any other sides involved.
Great class, very interesting material, but the professor never stopped talking. It was basically a monologue and ever so often she would ask the class a question, but no no one would answer because it would take her at least ten minutes to ask a question. We also did not discuss most of the readings that we did, which is kind of frustrating. But the material is great and the assignments are pretty fun to write.
I really loved this course. The readings, films, and topics were super interesting. I liked how what we learned was connected to current issues and hot-button topics today. This class inspired me to switch my major to Gender Studies!
okay course, lots of reading and papers were graded a little harder than expected. thought this class would be more of a discussion but mostly just Amy talking and a few comments from the few who usually speak in class
This course wasn't too bad you have to attend every class as that is the only way you will gain any information. The lectures are pretty boring but the professor is really nice. There are 3 short papers (3-4 pages) and then one final paper. The grading is tough but you can resubmit assignments to get points back.
Discussions were interesting, but sometimes prolonged to the extent I had no idea what we were even talking about anymore. You really have to focus for the whole class or else you will fall behind really easily. All the writing assignments were back loaded into the last few weeks of the class which was stressful around finals time. You really need to stay on top of your work in order to "stay on the bus and not get crushed by the next one".

Comments
An extremely interesting and fun course to take for a distro that is a bit heavy on reading, but is not too time-consuming. The papers push you to think critically so they can be challenging, but the class prepares you very well to take on these topics.
This is one of the best classes I have taken at NU. Carrillo made me smile every day. I planned on dropping this class because it doesn't fulfill any requirements for me, but every class I went to was so satisfying that I could not let myself drop it.
This is a really interesting course and Professor Carillo is a good lecturer; it's somewhat challenging but overall worth it
I feel like I have a comprehensive understanding of the history of human sexuality, which is awesome.
This course is AWESOME- by far my favorite class I have taken at Northwestern. The material is super interesting and the professor is super cool and passionate about the topics taught in class.
It was very good. I liked that my attention was grabbed in every lecture. Unfiltered
Very interesting class. highly recommended. you will learn a lot about sexuality in this course. Professor carrillo fuse various perspectives and schools of thoughts together without confusing one perspective with another. contents are interesting. though you have to read a lot readings for that class, most readings are fun and even mind-blowing. good course to take if you want to see what gndr study is like
The topics covered were super compelling and interesting, but sometimes the assigned reading could be way too overwhelming.
The course is great and well-structured. It consists of one midterm and two essays, all of which are manageable if you review the major aspects of each sociologist you discuss in class and their respective reading assignments.
The class is named Sexuality and Society, yet there was ONE reading on queer female sexuality in the entire class. Often during class Professor Carrillo (who is a great instructor) would make claims about homosexual identity or sexuality using research that exclusively talked about gay men. I found this bias and general lack of content on queer female sexuality incredibly disappointing and uncomfortable at times.
weekly discussion questions can be annoying but lectures are interesting and fun. lots of reading and you have to do them. go to lectures!
I found the course very interesting and relevant to modern society. I would highly recommend the course.
Amazing class, Professor Carrillo was a great instructor and the course material was very interesting, work wasn't ridiculously tough but readings could be a bit dense at some points. Essays and test are manageable as long as you allocate time well.
The professor absolutely ROCKED this class. It was one of the most fun and engaging classes that I have had at Northwestern. Considering it was a larger sized lecture, we still had discussions during class that helped me to keep engaged.The readings were very insightful but at the same time there were too many to keep up with.
The lectures were engaging and for the most part the materials felt relevant.
Carrillo is THE BEST. He truly cares that we’re learning and engaged and happy. The course material is very interesting although I wish we spent more time studying sexual identities. I came away with a much deeper understanding of sexuality, but no “answers” because there are none. But it’s definitely helped me reflect on my own sexuality and question all the scripts I’ve been told my whole life. It’s changed the way I think and I am so grateful. The course isn’t that difficult and is truly worth it.
This class is such a good elective to take! It's so so interesting and brings up aspects of sexuality I had never even thought about. Carillo is so energetic and keeps the lectures interesting.
This was my first gender studies class at Northwestern. I am an engineer and I took the class because I was interested in this topic. I thought this class was really great and I enjoyed it a lot. From Professor Carrillo's general care and interest in this class to the supportive TAs, I felt this that class made me comfortable around a topic that I knew little about. I learned a lot because we covered a lot of topics. The readings can be a lot, but in class we really break them down and get the main ideas cleared up. The discussion section was sometimes boring but came in handy for reviewing for the midterm and prepping for writing the essays. In general, I think that if you are thinking of taking a gender studies class that this would be a good option.
This class is great. The material keeps you engaged and Carrillo is a great lecturer and an overall wonderful and genuine human being. This class taught me so much about sexuality and the ways in which it operates in society. I'm glad I took this course. For those of you being financially conscious of courses and course materials--all you need is a clicker subscription in this class. All of the readings are online thanks to Carrillo.
TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HECTOR. He's the most enthusiastic professor I've ever had, and he's the kind of professor that makes you want to go to lecture. The readings were varied and interesting, and nothing's off the table in this class and discussion. A great intro to gender and sexuality studies if you're pursuing that. Highly recommend.
This is an enjoyable course, although a bit heavy on the readings. Professor Carrillo is great and watching him teach was always a joy, but some aspects of the course were a little overdone/their purpose was not clearly communicated.
If you're debating taking this class then just go for it, especially if you're not a sociology/psych major. A lot to learn about sexuality (not much about sex though; if you take the class you can easily explain the difference ;) ). Carrillo is a fantastic prof, very eager to teach and amazing at explaining stuff. Also authored some of the reading you'll do in the class, which is honestly not that much (I usually did them in 1-2 hours the day before each class).
I went into this class thinking that I was fairly knowledgeable about the subject, but I was surprised by how much I learned. Professor Carillo is an amazing professor, and his lectures are always very engaging and interesting. I really enjoyed the polls he conducted in class. In terms of the discussion section, I think it really varies, depending on which group you get. For the most part, I had a positive experience, but opinions can definitely become very polarized.

Comments
Course is interesting and not that hard. You don't have to do all the readings, just enough to get the discussion questions done and write solid papers. Lectures are interesting and Professor Norton is a very understanding, approachable guy. He wants you to enjoy the subject matter and do well.
This class was really interesting and taught very well.
I took this course as a last second distro, but was surprised by how interesting it was. It changed my way of thinking. It was a lot of reading and the papers were challenging but I learned a lot.
A wonderful survey of issues I knew I was interested in but didn't know much in-depth about, excepting personal experience. Thoroughly enjoyed being challenged.
A lot of reading, super fun interesting lectures
This was a great class. It's organized really well and Professor Norton is so nice and knows how to keep lectures interesting.
This class is very interesting and has a good range of interesting material and videos
There was a lot more reading than I was expecting, and much of it was very dense. That said, Aaron gives really good lectures and you can often get away with reading one out of several readings for each class, or skimming all of them. Overall, there are a lot of very cool discussions about complex ideas relating to sexuality.
Professor Norton is amazing. Having class with him was really fun. People had different opinions and they could voice it without feeling judged. Most of the readings were easy and really interesting.
This is such an incredible course. Professor Norton is an amazing teacher and absolutely hilarious. Its not an easy A, but if you do work and pay attention, its not hard to do well.
It covered a great range of topics from women's issues to racism. There was no issue the course shied away from.
SUCH AN INTERESTING COURSE. Aaron is a very funny and enjoyable lecturer; lots of polls in class; fun music at the beginnings. He knows his information and relays it well. Do the readings each week, they're actually really interesting.
Very interesting. Essays were tough
This course was very interesting and Aaron is a great professor.
This course is great. I learned a lot while still not doing much work. The professor is truly amazing - so funny and knowledgable.
Professor is nice, but his exam questions are not that nice
He does not fully use slides, so if u are a visual learner, it could be hard to catch up his saying
General learning about gender and society, learning a lot, broadening ur perspective on world, yet quite lots of reading
I took this course because I thought it was a distro BUT IT IS NOT A HISTORY DISTRO. Aaron is very funny and sweet, but he could ramble at times. We did polls which needed a clicker˼licker technology which were cool. Both papers were very demanding and mentally taxing to write because of how theoretical they were. Todd was a great TA. CRAZY AMOUNT OF READINGS!!!! Some days had over 60+ pages, and there was NO WAY TO KEEP UP.
A good gender studies intro. The readings are interesting but the overview of sexuality is pretty basic. If you've taken gender studies before/ are LGBT, you will spend a lot of time rolling your eyes. If not, then its a good 101
This course is super interesting! The reading is relatively heavy and a little dense at times, but at other times it is super interesting and a little raunchy! My professor gave excellent lectures, so on occasion I could definitely get by without doing the reading. There is one exam, which you can definitely get a good grade on if you review powerpoints, and two 5-6 page essays.
This is a great class! Aaron is hilarious and an amazing teacher! The readings are super interesting (kinda long) but usually worth it. The two papers are difficult but doable
You'll learn a lot in this class if you haven't had much experience with gender studies before and it's really a lot of fun. My only complaint was that the professor has tailored the course material so that it focuses very heavily on homosexual men; while it's an interesting topic I think the class would be better served by spreading the focus out a bit
Best professor that I had this quarter. Aaron makes class unbelievably fun. All the information that you need for the midterm is from the lectures but the readings are definitely helpful in providing additional details about lecture topics. Discussion sections are thought-provoking. Most material is relevant in today's society. GREAT COURSE
I took this class to see if I was interested in Gender and sexuality studies and was disappointed. The vast majority of the readings˼ontent in the class was focused on/written by men. Professor Norton has a very roundabout lecture style. The prompts for the essays were too broad. We were asked to discuss 5 articles in a 5 page paper which made it virtually impossible to focus on a narrow specific subject and really dig deep into it while still following the prompt.
So informative, Norton is an amazing professor, totally manageable amount of work, and always emotionally and intellectually engaging. Such a wonderful class.
Fantastic class! Aaron is amazing and brought light to so many important topics in such a fun, friendly, and perfectly quirky manner.
I was pretty interested in this class material but then after the in-class midterm which actually had to relate to all the material covered during the first half of the quarter, I lost a lot of interest in the subject, mainly because the rest of the graded assignments were essays only covering one topic. Aaron Norton is such a soft-spoken guy but he is really nice and cares about his students. Really don't have to go to a lot of the classes after the actual midterm in class.
The course overall is super interesting. A really great distro especially when taught by Prof. Norton. My ideas about sexuality were constantly questioned and I was consistently intrigued by the material.
Discussion section was what made this class very worthwhile for me. Though lecture was interesting, I gained so much real world understanding from my TA (V) and the other students in my section. Aaron does a great job of clearing up the reading and presents the points you need to know.
This was a fantastic class! Aaron is an awesome prof, and it was a really effective survey course, considering how easily it could have become unfocused with the massive amount of content covered. It made me think more critically about gender and sexuality, and even though a lot of the topics were not new to me, I found it to be really engaging and learned tons.
In my opinion, this is a great course with a great instructor and great TA's. This course really opened my eyes to the complexities of sexuality as it relates to many aspects of our society that might not always be as straightforward as it may seem. Though some readings were quite long and some of them slightly difficult to grasp at first, Aaron and the TA's really help break it down into simpler terms. Highly recommend this class.
This class really put me out of my comfort zone bc I've never taken a class on this topic before. A lot of reading but not entirely necessary that you do it. In class midterm and two take home essays. If you take this class be ready to feel uncomfortable!
This course was such an eye-opening experience and it was funny and genuine and practical. Aaron Norton is an amazing professor
This course was great! It was always interesting, and Aaron is really invested in the students and making class engaging. You learn a lot about modern issues while still learning about things you didn't know about before. The readings can be a bit long but they're usually interesting.
I really enjoyed this class. I felt like Aaron was able to keep it fresh and keep things current. If something happened over the weekend that would relate to something we learned or are learning, heɽ include it in the next lecture. Definitely a class worth taking if you're interested in learning about multiple forms of sexuality in our own society and societies around the world.
Interesting, low-stress introductory course on sexuality and its interactions with sociology. As an LGBT student I came in having a deeper and different perspective because of my identity which likely left me to get less out of the class than others might have. Still the class had some interesting readings and discussions were informative on hearing about the experiences of others.
The course was super interesting but at times a little too wishy washy for me.
Professor Norton is a wonderful teacher and is very excited and open about the topics in Sexuality in Society. The class looks at a wide range of communities and theoretical frameworks, all of which were presented with engaging articles and lectures.
Prof. Norton is amazing. He provides great readings and explains them very well. He was so fun and a great Prof. to have. Very good teacher as well.
The instruction in this class was always engaging and broke down the readings without over-simplifying.
This course is awesome. It introduced me to more ideas about sexuality in general and how people work in general and the importance of sex in people's lives. The professor is so nice, supportive, and his jokes are pretty good. It was a pleasure to take that class and learn about something that's considered so taboo. I'm sad it's over.
I really enjoyed Prof. Norton's lectures -- he was engaging and thought-provoking, which made me happy to attend the larger courses. The midterm was fair, and the essays allowed deeper engagement with material, so I liked the assessment methods in the course.
Aaron was an incredible professor! This course wasn't too hard, with a discussion section, midterm, and two essays (one of the essays was the final). It was also super interesting.
This course is great! Very interesting content and taught by a very fun professor. I actually enjoyed writing the essays and doing the reading
fantastic course with a great professor. Norton is such a nice person and makes most of the lectures really interesting. readings and class material are all super interesting, a few of the readings were a bit long. midterm is pretty easy and only two essays, which aren't graded too hard.
I thought that the breadth of topics that we covered through different texts provided a comprehensive view of the subject and I found the readings interesting to read. Additionally the papers for this class felt easy to write due to the wealth of information I gained from the course.

Comments
I absolutely loved this seminar-style course. The readings were, for the most part, super engaging and interesting. I would 100% recommend this course. Professor Stokes is the coolest and is also considerate about students' needs. She is always willing to help and responds quickly to emails.
Well... The other options for the "Historical Studies" distro made me want to pull my teeth out with my bare hands. This class wasn't awful, but I wish it were an actual history course. Itɽ definitely not; instead, it's about reading articles at home and discussing in class about their impact or something. Not what I'm interested in, sorry!
Love this course so much, it was honestly v interesting. IT SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO TAKE A TRANS* HISTORY COURSE!!!!
I thought his course was really good, I loved the topic and really enjoyed learning about trans identities throughout history.
Trans history is not Trans studies. I don't feel that this should be in the gender studies department if the faculty is not an adjunt gender studies prof.
This is such an amazing course. I absolutely adore the fact that Northwestern offers classes like this. It's so important, and this class is absolutely fascinating. Also Professor Stokes is a GEM
This was such an important class for me. I hope that Northwestern continues to offer more classes about trans history and trans studies.
I don't feel like I was particularly challenged or enlightened in this class, but it was definitely interesting at times and an overall enjoyable class.
I enjoyed the readings focusing on queer/LGBT life in Paris, focusing on institutionally forgotten or minimised aspects of history
I LOVED this course. Awesome subject matter, interesting professor, fun lectures. Workload was super manageable, my favorite class this quarter.
This course helped me learn about the unspoken and important presence that trans people have had throughout history. It also clarified the terminology that is used today to describe and discuss trans issues, while also acknowledging and displaying the differences in vocabulary because of generational gaps, geography, and other factors. This was also one of the first history courses I've taken, and I was able to explore the Northwestern archives for the first time, look at primary sources, and take a gender studies topic from a historical perspective.
The course was very well structured, pairing academic and historical readings with in course discussion and collaboration. Professor Stokes facilitated thought provoking instruction and did a fantastic job of tailoring the course to our class's needs. There were three short papers and a final project, that allowed for creativity in the form of an art project.
While it is clear that Professor Stokes is amazing and suer knowledgable on this content, her expectations for readings to prepare for class were CRAZY. No one is able to read 100+ pages of dense text between 2 days of class. Also, I feel like I would have gotten a lot more out of the class if it would have been lecture-based instead of discussion-based. We have this amazing professor in front of us and I wanted her to just teach us the material insead of listening to classmates talk about the readings for the entire class period.
This was my first history class and provided an historical approach to transgender studies. I found that the course lacked clearly articulated throughlines/themes, and it was hard to connect the readings to the scholarship we read.

Have you ever heard of a course named this before? NO, because nu doesn't offer enough intersectional courses!!! take it regardless of your background to be mindblown and learn about actual us history, cry a lil, get mad, etc. take advantage of the research paper (which is most of your grade) to write about something you are actually interested in!! and START EARLY! Professor Yuh is one of the smartest coolest profs at this school so you better do this
Professor Yuh is an insightful instructor and historian that presents history in an interesting and engaging way. I'm someone who hasn't liked history classes in the class, and this was perfect. Never was I bored or overwhelmed, and I really enjoyed the class discussions.
The class is structured like a lecture for classes, and then a discussion every other class. It's best to enter the class with a decent background in world history or asian-american history, as it brings more to the table for discussion. There were a lot of awkward pauses in class where Yuh would ask a question and no one would be able to answer.
This was a good introduction to Asian American women throughout American history. Yuh is a great professor who clearly is extremely well-versed in this topic. She facilitates discussion well in class and constantly encourages students to attend˼ommunicate with her through office hours. Iɽ say the class had a bit too much group discussion for my own taste (much prefer listening to her lecture), but overall I enjoyed being in class and it was very stimulating material. I also found some of the readings to be a bit dry — we did a lot of anthology reading, while I thought the other resources she offered were much more thought-provoking and engaging.
This class opened up my understanding of history beyond what I could have imagined
Loved it
Yuh could do a little better with organization of the course but the material and inesteuxrion was really valuable! Only a few assignments but she grades hard so they all count.
Yuh is really cool and the weekly readings aren't much. Three easy enough to do response papers and a 10 page final of your subject choice. Felt personal and would recommend.
Dr. Yuh is PHENOMENAL. She's extremely knowledgeable and very willing to work with students on assignments, etc. She knows what she's talking about, and gave a good survey of Asian American women from East and South East Asia. We very briefly touched on South Asian women, but the focus is on Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Japan. Dr. Yuh's academic work is also on Korea. The class was a little boring at times because it was done as small groups rather than lecture˽iscussion style, but the work generally was productive and helpful.
much reading please do it though it is super awkward to be the only person in class who contributes to discussion and Yuh is such an important Asian American scholar do not take her for granted

Comments
This class was great! It was a bit intimidating when I looked at the assignments for the quarter, but it's much less formidable when you begin, just don't start late. I'm glad I liked writing papers/was good at writing them. LaShonda is fun, quirky, and extremely knowledgeable. Black women's history is so important and is a fundamental class that everyone should take!
Lashonda is an abnormally engaging professor. Her investment in the material is unparalleled, and her willingness to teach is abundantly clear. I think that this quarter she was getting used to the quarter system, as it seems that she tried to pack a semesters worth of material into a quarter, which ended up being a lot of work. Also, the final paper is a comprehensive research paper, and i think that that could potentially turn people off to the GSS department.
When taking this course, I expected a more general into to Roots of Feminism class, but quickly learned LaShonda would be teaching it in a very different way, which I ultimately enjoyed, but a bit disappointed I did not take the traditional Roots of Feminism class. We have been told that this class will no longer be taught by LaShonda and someone else will be taking it over and teaching it in the more common vein of a traditional class. I could see how this class would be frustrating to gender studies majors who needed these intro level Feminism classes to be adequately prepared for future more intense Feminism class.
The course material was awesome, but the instruction was much too geared towards note taking instead of expanding on the knowledge presented in the texts.
This course is extremely interesting. There is a lot more reading and writing than strictly necessary to learn the material, so I wouldn't recommend taking it unless you are really interested in the subject. I had to take it for my major, and probably would have dropped if I didn't have to keep taking it because of the workload and the way lectures were structured.
This course has a lot of reading and essays, so make sure to STAY ON TOP OF YOUR WORK! The readings are not always necessary to do, but make sure you at least have some idea of what it was about so that you can participate. Some of the essays seem pointless, but in the end you realize they will help you with your final paper. I learned a lot.
Lashonda is a very hip professor but this class with her is a lot of reading and writing. She also calls on people to speak in class, which is panic-inducing
This is a really great course, it's interesting and you will learn a lot if you are willing to put in the time. Fair warning though, it's a lot of work, with a 200 page final essay
LaShonda is one of the most engaging and engaged professors I've ever encountered, but the lectures are mostly summarizing readings, which felt like a waste of time.
Take this class! Professor LaShonda is not only incredibly knowledgeable about the subjects of African American women's history, literature, and feminism, but also takes the time to bring the concepts learned about in the readings to current issues. Like any other class, do the readings and come to class prepared and you will do well.
LaShonda is an awesome professor. She's very funny, engaging, and passionate. The class discussions were really interesting, but sometimes I felt like we were talking about the same things over and over again. This class is A LOT OF WORK. You have to do the readings every day (she will call you out if you don't), essays almost every week, attendance is taken, and a 20 page final paper. However, I think it was worth it because I learned a lot about a topic that's usually ignored in mainstream history and because LaShonda is a great professor.
I think Professor Barnett's ability to push what I thought I knew about the portrayal of black women was very helpful in challenging my previous understanding of black women's history.
This course was really reading and writing intensive.
The professor and the TA were absolutely fantastic
Very interesting course and LaShona is great, but requires a lot of work (i.e. writing like 8 papers, one of them being 15-20 pages)
There were many assignments, but the material was interesting and was engaging, and the assignments were graded generously
I loved the content of this course because it was all very new to me; however, the work load could be a little much at times. Many of our assignments were very heavy reading and papers every week, which is a bit heavy for a 200 level class.
This course was not well designed for the quarter system. Too much reading. Definitely can get away without reading if you're a strong writer, though.
What a course. Yes, this class demanded a lot of me, but really did succeed in pushing me outside my comfort zone. This is important material that I had very little exposure to before this course. I highly recommend taking a class taught by this professor.
This class is a lot of reading and even more writing. It is challenging to actively participate in the class if you do not glance at the readings and take notes before class.
This class taught me so much about African American women's history and found it invigorating to be learning about the creation of feminism or womanism in the African American community which is not talked about when learning about feminism in other classes.
This course was daunting at first, but the TA's and professor were very understanding of the challenges students may have throughout the course.
For me, the parts of the class that were the most important were the lively and expert lectures by the professor, the engaging discussions that occurred in class, and the readings that were assigned. Overall, Iɽ describe taking this class as a challenging yet enriching experience that was well worth the time I spent in it. While the readings were long and there was a rather large number of essays to write, I genuinely thought that the class taught me a lot of things about African-American women's history, culture, and experiences that I didn't know beforehand and helped shape me into a more knowledgeable, socially aware citizen.
Lashonda can be disorganized but facilitates really good discussions.
The course load was actually wild (it would have fit a semester schedule better) and it was nearly impossible to get all of the reading done. Buuut it wasn't hard to still participate in discussions. This class was not treated like an intro class, which is what it is so that was kinda frustrating. Also the final paper was 15-20 pages and everyone I know who was also in the class was dying over it so yeah that kinda sucked but we got to pick our own topics so that was cool. The material itself was poppin though, like yes finally there's a class that's centered on the history of Black women. *snaps*
I LOVED THIS CLASS AND LASHONDA BARNETT WITH ALL MY HEART. I'm not sure if LaShonda will still be teaching this course but if she is you absolutely must take it! I had heard that this class was super whitewashed so I was hesitant about taking it but I guess Northwestern figured that out and changed up the professors. The work load was a tiny bit absurd but its fine if you can deal with a million readings a week and an essay due every other week.
LaShonda was an amazing teacher, but did a little too much hand holding. She explained the material very well, and got to the major points of the authors. The course was well paced, and not overwhelming. As a prereq for GSS majors/minors, it is a good class, especially when taught from Black women's history. It did NOT address the intersection of Black and queer, which was a major issue.
I am so disappointed in this class. It was terrible. From day one, LaShonda was unprepared and rude. Also, if you're actually a Black woman, ironically you'll enjoy this class the least, as it is just a clapping party for non-Black women and those who say 'nice' things about us. So so so much wrong with the instruction of this course. Also, neither of the TAs were Black? The prof came close to an hour late one time to class and proceeded to tell the class that WE sucked. Little to no help with questions regarding material. Very elitist view on Black politics, such is the life of being so embedded into academia. She also often misgendered a student in the class. I don't recommend the class at all. Go to the AfAm department and get some real critical thinking on Black women's history.
This course was a lot of work... a lot. And it was so worth it. I have yet to take a course in college where I was excited to actually put in the time for the amount of reading that was required. LaShonda did an excellent job of facilitating class discussion during lecture, which made class time worthwhile. Before taking this class, I was ignorant of how much information gets left out of US History when black women aren't included. I not only learned so much about history, but also about how historical trends pervade our own society. If you want to take a class that is hard work and worth it, this is it.
This class approaches the very important topic of African American Women's History. I do not recommend taking this class with Professor Barnett as it seemed as though she took a semester course load and stuffed it into a quarter. The classes were not incredibly well organized, as there were no powerpoints or very specific things to learn, but the reading materials were interesting overall and the essays were not incredibly difficult, except for the final 15 page paper. Overall, I think the topic something that everyone should learn about, but I do not believe that Prof. Barnett was the best professor for really teaching everyone about the importance of the subject.
The classes weren't helpful unless you read and there were too many readings to do realistically with a heavy course load.
I learned A LOT from this class! It was also a lot of work though.
Being a person of color in this class can be difficult because you are still in the minority. It can be frustrating when you're overlooked, especially being a Black woman and discussing the aspects of life FOR a Black woman, but I appreciate the class for allowing me to debate and not be closed off to other opinions and interpretations of text. The analysis I cared the most for, and I'm satisfied with all I was taught.
This class is EVERYTHING (with a few minor details that one must take into consideration). Okay first of when else are you going to have the opportunity to take class taught by a BLACK, WOMAN professor who is teaching you about African-American Women's history? NEVER because it has not exist! This class will teach so much and help change the way that you view intersections of race and gender. Keep in mind that the book list is long (THERE ARE EIGHT BOOKS HOLY SHIT), but you can ACCESS THEM ALL FOR FREE ONLINE FROM THE NU LIBRARY!!!!! Secondly, there are a lot of pages to write for this class. The amount of writing required is insane like we did 6 to 8 different papers with varying lengths. You may be thinking wow I can't do that, but yes you can because you are smart. Third thing to keep in mind is that you HAVE TO READ everything (well not really bc I didn't read and not once was I called on), but essentially LaShonda loves, LOVES, LOVES to call on random students, and ask them questions about the reading so please take time to read (fill in:skim) the readings in order to feel semi-prepared.
The topic of this class is so amazing and I loved the books that we were exposed to in this class. However, there were way too many essays. Literally on day 2 we wasted an entire hour and twenty minutes explaining what an annotated bibliography. Needless to say, class discussion gets sidetracked WAY too easily and often, its only the same people getting called on who say valid things, but there isn't a diverse opinion if its only some of the same people talking. The assignments didn't focus nearly enough on black women and there was an unnecessary amount of essays that did not do much to aid my understanding of the class.
i really liked this class. very good reading materials and good conversation
This course was very interesting, and LaShonda does a great job of engaging students during lectures. The books we read were great and provided so much information that is lost in most historical texts, so I feel like I learned a lot.
I believe that the class was more focused on note taking and graphs than it was on the actual material. I don't feel like we discussed or learned to the best extent of Black women in history or their importance. I noticed my own deficits when I was writing my final paper, ultimately feeling like I should have learned more of this stuff in class than while doing outside research.
I wish we had focused on the feminist movments more. They were barely discussed and I feel as though I didn't learn much about "feminism" as I did just about African American history. (There's a happy balance that I think could have been struck)

Comments
I thought this course was very engaging and the discussion format of the class helped us to go beyond just the readings and see other people's perspectives.
I enjoyed the class discussion style very much, as it allowed people to share ideas and everyone to get a goo understanding of the material without pressuring people who were more shy or introverted to participate just to got points.. the discussions were well organized as well
This course was extremely interesting even as a student who has taken the Feminist Theory course for the major. I really appreciated that we discussed readings in class instead of having the lectures as a separate entity.
The "lecture" sections are like full-group discussion sections. The discussions in class were really interesting and I was happy to just sit and listen most of the time, but you would definitely get more out of it if you keep up with the readings and participate.
THIS IS THE BEST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN. Everyone should be required to take this class. I learnt so much about women, and the interlocking oppressions that exist due to race, class, gender and sexuality. I became a better writer, better thinker and more confident speaker. It was life-changing for me. Jennifer Nash is the best professor I have ever had. She is awesome. No regrets. TAKE IT TO BE BETTER AND LEARN SOOOO MUCH.
This class really explored a wide variety of feminisms. It was clear that some people in the class really loved it. Definitely not a class that everyone would enjoy, but if you are interested in examining a real range of feminist texts, this class might interest you.
There is a lot of reading. Luckily, they are very interesting but can take a lot of time. The lectures themselves are very engaging and Professor Nash is fantastic. The papers are relatively easy, but hopefully your TA is good. Do not take this class if you don't want to read. There is a final exam and three papers that require you to know the readings very well.
Class participation is key. In class, there are "regulars" and "semi-regulars" when it comes to participation, so it can be difficult for a shyer person to get in. If you're a shy person, the discussion sections are a lot less intimidating, and it's a bit easier to get your participation points that way. As far as the readings, there are times where you need to take plenty of time out of your day to get them done, but they are very interesting nonetheless, and the arguments are usually straightforward. The professor and TAs do a fantastic job teaching the context of the readings to us. Also, the essays are quite fun to write since they are less about the readings and more about developing your own personal viewpoint. Overall, interesting subject matter, but expect a lot of class participation for a lecture course.
Professor Nash is truly a phenomenal lecturer. She is engaging, passionate, and is great at facilitating lively discussion.
Professor Nash is easily the best professor I have ever had at NU. She is kind, witty, engaged and just overall a great professor to have for such an important subject. Personally, I feel that every student at NU should be required to take one gender studies class — I just wish everyone could have Prof. Nash. The content is very intriguing and you will find yourself reevaluating your presence in this world from a gendered lens — all good things! Take this class. Seriously.
This is an amazing course I think everyone should take it. It allowed me to see the world in a different light and I am a more mature thinker because of it!
Just brilliant. Necessary to the way we think in today's day and age.
You learn so much about interesting feminist discourses. However, the breadth of required reading was definitely discouraging and made the course less pleasant and tolerable than I would have hoped for.
This class is a great introductory course for GSS majors/minors. It challenges a lot of the beliefs one holds about society in an academic way. There's 3 papers and a final, and the final is all about the readings so do the readings when they're assigned. The lectures were discussion based and always entertaining and informative
Take a class with Prof. Nash. She's amazing.
Readings can be very dense and class discussion can move very quickly. One of the most intellectually stimulating classes I've taken so far.
Professor Nash is an all star professor. Not only is she extremely knowledgable and passionate, but she really facilitates and engages the class with every lecture. there was never a boring moment. It felt like everyone in class was passionate about being there and we all learned so much.
A lot of work for a distribution requirement. Interesting topic, but the conversation was frequently dominated by GSS majors and was sometimes really lofty.
This class was so interesting, but I was a little overwhelmed by the readings. Additionally, because it's so free form and discussion based, it's hard to know what the takeaway should be as a student (and what is necessary to know for finals).
Prof Nash is super cool but I'm not a huge fan of how the class was run. I would have rather heard more of her own thoughts on and explanations of the material than listen to freshmen grasp at straws. She also definitely had her favorites and would call on them over others. But still a good distro with a lot of cool readings.
Take this class with Prof. Nash !! She is one of the most engaging professors I've ever had - what could have been a standard˻oring lecture ended up being a thought-provoking and challenging discussion every single class.
I overall enjoyed the course. However, many times there were too many readings assigned for some classes. While the readings were interesting, the length of the articles made it difficult to read the essays in depth. Additionally, the class lectures were a discussion amongst the whole class, which had about 70 people, making it at times difficult to contribute to the discussion. Also, throughout the course, we wrote essays but the final exam was comprehension based, which was quite difficult to prepare for since we have read over 40 articles.
I loved the course- the readings were super interesting and the Professor was amazing.
The tools this course gave me to think about the world and gender and race are invaluable and I use them every day.
I loved this course. I learned about a diverse array of topics relating to feminist thought, and lots of different voices and perspectives were discussed.
dr. nash was the first black professor that ive had at nu and was super excited to take. she leads class in a very efficient manner and truly asks the hard hitting questions that make you think outside of the box. you can tell who her favorites are though which is annoying but thats the only bad thing about the class
TAKE THIS COURSE!!! It's a really amazing course that will make you question a lot of things about society. The readings can stack up on the weekend, but they aren't as hard during the week.
PLEASE get ready to read so much. This class has so much reading to do and it is expected that you do it because the entire class is lecture based. Because almost all of the material was interesting it wasn't hard to read. But you have to put work into this class if you want an A. There are no powerpoints and she takes very vague notes on the board, so you must take good notes and pay attention during class bc this will help a lot with assignments. There are 3 five-page papers and 1 comprehensive final on everything starting from day one. Side note: She doesn't allow technology so you will have to write all of your notes
I really enjoyed this class. The course consists of three 5 page papers that are very manageable and weekly discussion sections with one cumulative final which was not too difficult. Professor Nash opens up the class to discussion which is helpful because it allows the class to cohesively figure out and argue over what each author seems to be discussing in their work. The literature discussed in class was extremely interesting and never horribly long.
Prof. Nash is an incredible professor with lots of insight on the course topic and materials. She really challenges students to explain why they have the opinions they do. She doesn't let you hold any position comfortably/unquestioningly, which makes for great class discussion. She's also a really funny and approachable professor. Class materials were chosen very carefully and were very cohesive/illuminating. Everyone should take a gender studies class (or multiple) and this is a great place to start.
I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in gender studies, and even someone who isn't. There are readings assigned every class, which can be a lot sometimes, but they are all very interesting. The class setting is a very good discussion and you really get to dissect the readings and authors. There are 3 papers due and a cumulative final, so not too much. This class will definitely expose you to a variety of viewpoints.
I loved this course first and foremost because Jennifer Nash is an incredible, engaging professor who knows how to facilitate discussion even in a class with upwards of 80 students. The readings felt very focused, interesting, and not excessive. I was willing to put my time and effort into doing the work because I felt like the materials were actually worth learning. I wish we got more feedback on our essays.
This is the BEST class I have taken at Northwestern, and I am nearly positive it will be the best class I will EVER take at Northwestern. The readings are expertly chosen and are organized into very interesting and all-encompassing sections (feminism and the home, the state, sexuality, and the politics of location). This class will change the way you view activism and feminism⿾minists on Northwestern's campus and in the world. It will also challenge the way you view yourself as a feminist, a social activist, and a student at this university. The class is extremely manageable and leaves you with a wealth of information to bring into other classes and disciplines. TAKE THIS CLASS! You will NOT regret it.
Very interesting content but a lot of homework. You have to do all the readings in order to keep up with class discussions.
Really interesting course, I took this for a history distro and we had some great discussions. There is a lot of reading each week and the papers were a bit rough because they weren't like the english papers i was used to writing. Overall still definitely recommend this class
I loved Dr. Nash she is an amazing lecturer. I really appreciated how she connected issues of race with gender and sexuality in this class. Sometimes the texts were long and seemed largely unnecessary, but on the whole very interesting.
I really recommend this class for all students. I was happy to see a diverse group of students taking the course, men and women. I learned a lot in this course and found myself discussing the course material outside of class. This class helped me learn to think of issues in a deeper way.
This course was amazing. I did not know what to expect going into it, but Professor Nash made it engaging, challenging, and fun. There were a lot of people in the class, but it never felt like it was too big to be able to talk and speak your mind.
the reading can pile up, especially since you can get away with participating in class discussion without having read, but try to stay on top of it so you don't have to cram before the final. lectures were very discussion based, which I loved, & discussion section allows you to contribute a bit more since prof nash can't call on everyone during lecture. nash is the best, i really hope i get to take another class with her!
This was an incredible class. Jen is an engaging lecturer and the course materials are super fascinating and well curated. This class challenged me to interact with the world differently and I loved it. The workload was very manageable and was a great survey of feminist thought.
Best course I have ever taken at Northwestern. The TA's and the professor worked very well together to make this class an amazing experience. This course is requires you to think but its about topics that are so relevant and fascinating. The readings were great. I wish could take the class again.
I really enjoyed this class. Though some of the readings are long, all of the readings are interesting and very relevant to the course. The in class discussions were very engaging and helped to explain the texts if any of the texts were confusing. They also related to everyday life which made the discussions even more interesting. Nash was a great teacher and a very enthusiastic and engaging lecturer.
Very interesting and intellectually engaging course, but a LOT of work (about 40 different texts + papers + written, in-class final). The class itself is very thought-provoking and has a great element of discussion and debate for such a large class, but be prepared to spend a ton of time reading rather dense (many legal) texts.
This course is great, but challenging. The entire class is one big discussion, which I loved. You don't want to be on your computer for this class or else you WILL miss something. You have to take notes and pay attention. You also shouldn't miss class because missing one day can make it hard to study for the final. The course had really interesting material and engaging discussion, but it's definitely one that has longer readings and challenging assignments.
Loved this class for its range of readings. The paper topics and class discussions seemed distanced in the sense the paper looked for clarity on subjects that were discussed abstractly in class.
LOVED this class. Professor Nash is wonderful, and I've already recommended this class to so many people.
I was really interested in the intersect of race and gender and this class was great with touching on all intersections in gender studies.
I took this class expecting a more basic introduction to feminist thinking, but I felt like a lot of the material was above my head. The class was essentially 80 minutes of discussion, which I thought would be really cool at first, but it became difficult to follow the conversation sometimes because there wasn't much guidance from Professor Nash. However, I think that if I had focused a bit more and read the texts more closely this wouldn't have been nearly as much of a problem for me. This class requires a lot of reading of difficult texts, but if you don't read, it most likely won't be a problem (she calls on people who don't raise their hands sometimes).
Professor Nash was a wonderful facilitator of discussions and I enjoyed the breadth of the reading list.
I enjoyed reading the historically important texts that inspired the way we think as feminists today and the discussions in class were very constructive and eye opening
Take any class you can with Professor Nash. Superb lecturer, great reading selections.
This course introduced me to new authors and works that I had never heard of before. It forced me to challenge my own beliefs and to really learn what I believe in. Professor Nash was incredible and always kept the class engaged and sought to gain multiple perspectives and ideas. She loved to engage us in debates and pushed us to think deeper about each text. She really tried to know everyone's name and you could tell she cared whether or not we understood what we were learning. She would also make jokes and keep the class super lively. The class was lots of discussion, however, which at times made it difficult to understand the actual text that we read.
Take this course if you are interested in classes that are very much discussion-based. The readings are interesting but very long... there are usually 2 per class. They took me a while to read when I did read them. Jennifer is great, funny and knowledgable. If you are interested in woman's rights and speaking up in class, this may be the class for you. If you aren't big on participating, you might not get much from the class.

Comments
Really good class. Prof. Ward is very smart and describes himself as "woke." The class is structured pretty well, but there are some components of it that just seem like extra work for no reason (i.e. the journal and the second midterm). It's really interesting subject material, and most readings are of reasonable length. Discussions in class can get a little off-topic, but they're still pretty interesting and engaging.
Handouts are given in each class summarizing the reading, so you don't always need to do it. Professor Ward walks through and explains everything very in-depth. There's only 2 midterms and 2 papers with a few supplementary assignments. It's a pretty easy class and very interesting. You're essentially learning how to be woke.
I did not like all of the various assignments. Way too much writing in this class for a distribution requirement.
There was a ton of reading and most of it was interesting but sometimes it felt like way too much reading because it was all really dense. Classes themselves were kind of boring because if you did the reading carefully all you did in class was talk about it but it was basically just repeating the reading
Interesting topics, but the course was filled with like-minded students who were "preaching to the choir". Didn't get to hear much from the other perspectives, so the course was a little dry. Too many tangents from the professor and students
Amazing class. Professor Ward is hilarious. The class felt more like a huge discussion than a lecture. Very interesting content and readings. I had no idea how much gender disparity was present in linguistics, and this class really opened my eyes to many of the issues we have without feeling trivial in any way. There are many readings which are sometimes rather long, and you should plan to at least skim most of them if you want to be successful. There are two midterms, four reaction papers (short 1-2 page papers reacting to assigned readings) of your choice, a journal that you keep up throughout the quarter, a few short homework assignments, and a final paper or presentation.
Found this class really interesting and a really accessible gender studies class (because it's also linguistics so many non gss majors take it). Homework and midterms and mangable and fair. Reading is interesting and classes consist of going through important ideas and quotes from the reading. Professor Ward is fun and an entertaining lecturer.
This class is phenomenal. Professor Ward and his TAs clearly know their material, and they made this class so much fun. I looked forward to lecture and discussion because we talked about real issues that our apart of our everyday lives but in a new, refreshing way. Take this class, take this class, take this class.
Great distro class. Gendered language is relevant to literally everyone and the material was easy to digest. A fair amount of work, especially at the end of the quarter, but never overwhelming. Professor Ward is funny and the lectures are usually pretty interesting.
The class was super interesting and very intellectually stimulating. But by the second half of the course the readings started becoming kind of repetitive.
A very interesting subject combination- class discussions are captivating and the course will affect the ways you view language use by those around you
This course was really interesting, but I wish we could've studied less topics more in depth instead of almost a new topic every week. I loved how we had the option to present in class instead of a final paper/project and I wish all classes provided the same option! Professor Ward is very nice and approachable and presents the concepts in an interesting way, even if we moved very quickly though topics sometimes.
Cool class! Professor Ward is awesome, very funny and a really personable guy. TAs are also generally really good, I had V and they were awesome, great discussion leader. While I did feel like I learned things in this class, a lot of it is somewhat inferrable˼ommon knowledge. The first half of the class was the only portion where I really felt I learned concrete concepts; the second half left a lot to be desired and was kinda boring. You don't need to read the readings, just pay attention to the handouts and what's said in class and this should be an easy class.
This class is very interesting but there is a huge liberal bias.
The class provided good discussions on gendered language and expanded my knowledge on this subject.
Great class, learned a lot. Professor Ward is a fun lecturer. You have to do at least the major readings in order to do well, but the study guides help a lot. Second midterm is much harder than the first, but overall not a hard class at all
This course is so so so good and I highly recommend it to truly anyone regardless of academic interest. The content is relatable to anyone and everyone because it deals with the ways that we use language in relation to our gender identity, and so much of what we learned explained tendencies that people may not even notice about themselves. There are a lot of small assignments, but I found them really enjoyable because they made me think about the language people around me use. Studying for the exams wasn't hard either because the content just tends to stick with you because of how fascinating it is.
I learned a lot in this class. There were a lot of readings which were hard to keep track of for midterms, but discussion sections/handouts made the workload more bearable. Class presentations were engaging but erred on the side of too much unrelated discussion.
Highly recommend Language and Gender! Professor Ward is so smart and funny which keeps the class lively. V was also a great TA who clearly cared about their students so take their section if you can. Interesting material, and the kind of class where no one just ends up in because of a bad registration time, so everyone was interested in it. Especially important and topical in the world we live in today. Take this class!
Loved this course, Professor Ward is so well-spoken and great at leading discussion; the work gets a little tedious with the final paper and some of the student-led lectures weren't as good, but overall definitely a course worth taking.
Not great
I loved this class! Gregory is hilarious and so excited about language and gender that it's hard not to be interested in what he has to say. This class makes you reconsider the way you speak and is super relevant to most people's lives and language.
I was very surprised and happy with this class; it was definitely my favorite this quarter. We had large discussions where many people in the class felt comfortable sharing experiences, and we all were able to connect with the content on some level. Professor Ward is hilarious and made the class so enjoyable.
This course was great. It had my attention all quarter long.
This is a great class! Honestly I went into this expecting it to be about trans issues and it was p binary until almost the last lecture but it was still really informative/ fun. Ward goes off on all the tangents which actually made the lectures entertaining instead of annoying, which sometimes tangentially prone profs can get. (Ideally Ward will change the syllabus so the "questioning the binary lecture" comes earlier in the quarter but idk)
I really liked the professor who was so passionate about the material. I really liked it too, but it could be a little redundant˼ommon sense stuff if you were already socially aware.
Really interesting lectures, easy assignments just stay on top of them
Gender Studies 234 is an exceptional class that I would very much recommend to pretty much anyone at Northwestern. Although I personally am not extremely interested in the subject, I very much see the value in taking such a course and learning about gendered language and how it affects society. This class is not just a class for "sjw's" as everyone can benefit from being aware of the history of language and in what context we use it. The lectures are very informal and open for discussion, stories, etc that makes it much more interesting. The materials used in class are youtube videos, etc so they're very accessible. The professor is amazingly relatable and the very pinnacle of "cool", would recommend this class.
This was an amazing class! It was a really interesting and relevant topic. The readings were long but they went fast because they were actually fun and thought-provoking. Even the assignments for this class were enjoyable. I didn't know anything about linguistics before I took this class, but the pace was great even for a beginner. Take this class!
great class- amazing class
I entered questioning a linguistic minor and left decided on a linguistics major. Important and enjoyable class!
many pointless readings, not a lot of good discussion in class
The course was great since the Professor was engaged and made it easy for the students to be engaged. The provided reading were very helpful. Despite the class being an hour and 20 minutes, it definitely goes by fast because the topics discussed are so interesting.
Interesting class. Will make you think differently about the way you/other people speak. Lots of reading but most of it is covered in handouts.

Comments
Amazing course! Was on my senior year bucketlist to take a gender studies course and this one did not disappoint. The entire class is discussion based, Professor Ward is fantastic and provides great insights, but some of the most interesting things I learned were said by other students. It's not that hard either - the midterms were graded extremely fairly and it is really easy to study from the lecture outlines handed out every course. Take this class and learn about the differences between "girl," "woman" and "lady"!!
You don't just learn in this class; you become "woke". This really is a must take course; you will never look at language the same way again.
I loved this class. Professor Ward is knowledgable and passionate, and the TAs were all super. If you go to class, pay attention, and take notes on the daily handouts, the material is easy to handle.
This course is a LOT of work. tons of readings, weekly writing assignments for discussion section, multiple midterms, a big final project, a language journal, and four extra papers throughout the term. that being said, the content is interesting and Prof. Ward is a great lecturer. Iɽ recommend this class if it interests you and you have a lot of free time.
Amazing course it was extremely relevant in our day and age and you actually learn a lot about language and how our ingrained sexism is in our culture and how our culture affects language. Readings were interesting for the most part but the lectures go over the readings so its not super necessary to go to both
everything about this course with Professor Ward is absolutely phenomenal. the articles are interesting to read, handouts very clear - just show up to class and discussion and youll do fine on the midterm. very interesting intersection between linguistics and gender studies.
Overall, the content was interesting as gendered nature of linguistic differences were examined through various studies and theories. However, having separate sets of reading and homework assignments for the discussion sections did not really provide additional materials that were beneficial for the course. Readings for the class were rarely covered in full detail during lectures.
I think this course isn't particularly stimulating. The tests are reasonably easy (second midterm harder) and the discussion sections were good, however, most of the material covered was either common sense or completely redundant. I think the class environment was very "group-think" like in the sense that no one ever voiced opinions contradictory to the direction of the discussion taking place. Personally, I wouldn't recommend the course unless you have personal interest or want a (relatively) easy A.
Took this class for fun. It was still a lot of work (weekly writing assignments and readings), but this class was really interesting.
A good class that has a very interesting topic. Lecture can sometimes be repetitive but the class is very interactive and allows you to talk about your own opinion of the topics.
Professor Ward is an incredibly engaging professor, and I really loved this class.
This is a good class to take because it makes you more aware of your language use and how to be more responsible with your word choice. Very easy class. Readings are pretty easy, as are the midterms, papers, and projects. Lectures were really engaging and although it got a bit repetitive, I still learned a lot of valuable stuff. Would recommend this class.
Was sad that the class focused mainly on the two binary genders, but I became more aware of everyday gendered language.
this class is rad as hell, prof. ward is very chill and funny and smart. mostly lecture but also a lot of robust discussion that felt unusual for a class this size. readings can be kind of long and dense, but if you go to class they make sense
This course opened my eyes to so many gender inequalities that take place in everyday conversation! It gave me the awareness and the tools to analyze these inequalities, and recognize them and have conversations about them. I talked with my friends about this class a lot and what I was learning from it, because it was all so applicable. fair warning: lectures can be dry and boring. It functions as a big class discussion for the most part but it's often dominated by only a few people speaking, and it sometimes just gets pretty mundane. The student presentations are great--do it if you have the opportunity! You'll thank yourself later when you don't have to write the final paper. Overall, you learn really interesting things but truly...lecture is boring and that's not something to overlook when you are going to this class twice a week for ten weeks.
This is an AMAZING course. Very interesting, phenomenal professor that keeps the class engaged and creates great discussion. My favorite class I've taken thus far. Highly recommended to anyone looking for an easy distro
Ward is an awesome professor who made the class really fun. The HW was extremely manageable and easy. 2 Midterms and both were very straightforward.
I'm a feminist, but this class was intense. If you're enrolled for the "Language" part, expect so much more of the "Gender" part. Discussions in class could be interesting, but included a lot of preaching to the choir--not much learning going on. There was a short paper (1.5 to 2 pages) due every discussion section. Two midterms and an 8- to 10-page paper due finals week (unless you did a class presentation instead). Course wasn't bad, but somewhat subjective, work intensive, and completely erased any thoughts I had previously had of exploring a Gender Studies major. Gregory Ward is a great professor though, very engaging and informed (and--as the kids say these days--"woke").
A lot of work, especially writing. Have to conduct own research paper at end. Papers due every week in addition to more papers due intermittently. Was interesting material and learned a lot. However, if looking for an easy distro, look elsewhere.
This is a really interesting class and Ward is a good prof but there are a lot of busy work assignments that take up a lot of time
This course made me be more conscious of my language. It was more work than I anticipated (1 or 2 pages of homework a week, 4 short papers throughout the quarter, and a research paper at the end), and the readings were incredibly long, but it is the most interesting class I've taken at Northwestern. Very good introduction for a gender studies course if you're a bit hesitant. Loved gregory. Very funny
Honestly, if you're not super interested in the intersection between language and gender, consider not taking this class. Professor Ward is wonderful, but there are four reaction papers, weekly homework assignments, a comprehensive journal, a final project or paper and two midterms. There's the option to do a presentation instead of the final paper: TAKE THIS OPTION. Very worth it. Lots of work in this class I came very close to withdrawing.
This course is fun and not too work-heavy, however the texts are redundant and not always so interesting
This is the first linguistics/gender class I've ever taken, and I'm so happy I did because it is probably one of my favorite classes this quarter. The material was compelling, the discussions were animated, relevant, and up-to-date, and there always seemed to be the perfect balance between the time spent lecturing and the time spent discussing. The one thing I will say, though, is there is a lot of reading and you will crash and burn on the midterms if you fall behind. There are a lot of writing assignments that run parallel to what you need to read for lecture, so you've got to stay on top of it, but if you do it's really rewarding!
This course was really fun and interesting. All of the information in the readings were in his packets which made everything really accessible. Professor Ward is a really funny and entertaining person and I hope I get to take more of his classes in the future.
This class was interesting, but the weekly homeworks were a LOT of work for something that was only part of a participation grade. I was taking 2 upper-level STEM classes, and this 200-level linguistics class took more of my time than those two, combined. There is a lot of reading assigned but you definitely don't need to do all of it. Classes are mostly big discussions, and it's a lot of Woke 101, yet at the same time it operates almost exclusively with a gender-binary view...except for the last lecture which says "hmmm maybe the gender binary isn't real?" Still, you can use this class (especially the journal assignment) to become much more aware of gendered language, which is important in virtually every possible field.
VERY AWESOME CLASS!!! This class completely blew my mind and gave me so much to talk and think about with literally everyone around me. I feel smarter and more capable of understanding the world and myself because of this class. Greg is so positive (sometimes a little too excited so he speaks over other people who are supposed to be leading the class on that day), and he totally gets everyone amped up about linguistics. TAKE THIS CLASS
This class is great if you are at all interested or passionate about issues with gender and language. Professor Ward is a great lecturer and I found the subject matter to be fascinating, especially in the second half of the class.
This class is awesome! Professor Ward is engaging and extremely knowledgeable. The readings are usually fairly short and well covered in class. Everything that was talked about was very interesting and really makes you think about the way we speak. This course has a very distinct impact on my day-to-day life and was extremely enjoyable.
copied and pasted from the last question. this course sucks. its the biggest circle jerk of a class, absolutely pointless. the only thing i learned is that society is sexist (wow, what a shocker!). the entire class is complaining about issues without talking about actual solutions. and god forbid you try to point out that perhaps something isnt a gendered issue, you are WRONG. absolute bullshit. its disappointing, because this class could have been so good... its a distro requirement for me, but it had super good CTECs and people said its an easy A (theyre not exactly wrong on that-- its a lot of assignments, but you can bullshit them easily). but the main reason i took it was because it sounded interesting, and its not. i usually would go to class to get the note packets and then sneak out the backdoor because it was just mind numbingly dull.
THe material is fairly easy, however, I thought the TA grading was much harder than necessary at times.
This class was overall great. There is a Lot of 1-2 page writing homeworks, at least one per week. The material is interesting, although the readings and lecture are redundant. Lecture was most interesting for the discussion that arose with students concerning the material.
So much reading. Literally all class is is talking about the readings. They are interesting and relevant but many many pages. Hope you have a good TA because they all grade differently and your grade is too dependent on their subjective standards.
It was great, I’ve never thought about how i speak so much

Comments
The class was absolutely incredible, especially if you are interested in the HIV˺IDS epidemic. I took this class just out of interest and it exceeded my expectations. Aaron is an absolutely incredible teacher and I highly recommend taking one of his classes. He is so much fun and very interested in his work which makes the class so much more enjoyable. The workload is not too bad, just a lot of reading, but it all is extremely useful when it comes to the final essay and midterm essay. There are no tests which is great, and the material is not too challenging but definitely requires a lot of time and analysis to fully grasp all the concepts. In terms of weekly work there is reading each week and one reading response with a couple questions (not too challenging, you just need to do the reading to be able to do these) but other than that no other homework or work! Highly recommend taking!
This is one of my favorite courses I've taken at NU. The course material is really interesting, and the class was super engaged. We had great discussions, where it was easy to get participation points in. It is worth it to show up to every class because Aaron's lectures are great. Overall a really good class with a lot of informative topics that everybody should know.
Aaron Norton is fantastic! I learned so much in this class through both articles and class time. Aaron made every class interesting and open.
The structure of this course was perfect for the material. I loved the weekly reading responses because it encouraged and ensured that students (myself included) would read and be able to contribute to class discussion. The two papers were way better at helping us synthesize theories than any exam would be. The professor encouraged a level of discussion that was not only appropriate for the subject matter but also for the level of the course. Based on this and the subject matter -- which encouraged analytical thinking and a high level of openness -- was one of my favorites at Northwestern.
This course was very well taught and Aaron is a great professor who is passionate and very knowledgable about this issue. The weekly readings can be long but they are also extremely interesting so they go by really fast. In class discussions were very engaging and it challenged me to think about the HIV epidemic in ways that I never thought about before, in addition to challenging me to think differently about the issue as it exists today. This was one of my favorite discussion-based courses at Northwestern thus far.
I loved this course, readings were really interesting and Aaron is an amazing and very kind and understanding professor. This really expanded my way of thinking.
Great class with a great prof, not a ton of work with two papers and weekly reading summaries. Really interesting material highly recommend
This is an excellent course that really gives you a complete picture of the history of HIV˺IDS and the current state of HIV˺IDS. The reading is not too heavy and is for the most part super interesting. The course taught me the value that can be found in interrogating the moralism and bias that exists within science and the medical field, and it gave me a very good idea of how HIV˺IDS is still impacting the world today. The course makes a conscious effort to not focus at all on the gay, white male story of HIV˺IDS and stresses the importance of looking at the epidemic in populations of colors, trans communities, and heterosexual couples. Like any good gender/sexuality studies course, the class also challenges conventional beliefs about sex and gender. If you are looking for a great GSS course, TAKE THIS CLASS!
This is by far one of the best classes I have taken at Northwestern. Professor Norton is such a great person and so knowledgable about the content he is teaching. The readings are very interesting and the assignments are pretty manageable.
This was an incredible class to take this quarter. Aaron did a great job of balancing lecture and discussion and was very clear about grading˺ssignments. The content of the course was very informative and opened my eyes to a lot of public health issues that are occurring today.
This class is incredibly well done and organized--you learn a lot in a not stressful way
This is one of the best classes I've taken at Northwestern. I recommend this class, even if you aren't interested in AIDS/HIV.
I loved this class. Although it is a lot of work, with weekly reading responses due every Sunday and two essays, it is worth it. I feel like I have learned a lot and this has been one of my favorite classes at Northwestern. I highly recommend taking it even if you are not interesting in health/gender studies. It is a good way to learn about human nature and behavior.

Comments
The course was really a discussion section twice a week. The readings were interesting but unless you're really intrigued by the subject, don't take this course. It can get boring quickly if you're not interested.
The course provided solid textual and academic support to back theories and principles I found myself already familiar with. Overall, this course sparked major introspection into my own ambitions and curiosities, while promoting various perspectives and voices.
Really interesting course! As a gender studies course I struggled to understand and follow sometimes, but as an English course I really enjoyed close-reading the material.
This class is awesome. Professor Roth is super fun to work with and she has a lot of knowledge about reproduction in general. The readings and workload in general are very manageable. I think everyone should take a class about reproduction that does not focus only on abortion. Overall, a great class, I highly recommend.
This is my favorite class that I have taken thus far at Northwestern, which is shocking considering that until now, I have always hated English classes. The course is so interesting, so well taught, the sources are current and actually fun to read (popular media, contemporary narratives, etc.), and Sarah Roth is AMAZING. HIGHLY recommend.
LOVE LOVE LOVED this class. I learned so much about a topic that is not analyzed enough. The papers weren't too hard and Professor Roth is great!
I loved the course content and the emphasis on marginalized reproduction. Sarah Roth is a passionate professor, and is very willing to talk to and work with students based on their interests and challenges. She cares about student understanding of the material, and broader academia, as well as their understanding of her own points of view and experiences. Occasionally, the class discussion became very white and very cisgender, but the professor was willing to acknowledge and address this. She was transparent with her own struggles to and emphasis on marginalized reproductive experiences.
This class is mainly discussion based. It's most helpful to complete the readings by Monday, rather than spreading them across Monday and Wednesday class periods (as suggested by the professor).
Prof. Roth is amazing - she really cares about her students and helps to facilitate interesting debate in class. that being said, the course themes got really repetitive during the second half of the quarter and I felt like we were re-learning the same things with slightly different spins on them for the last few weeks

Great course
I liked the course overall although it was very different than I expected it to be. I thought it would be more focused on new technologies in reproduction and it was more about how culture defines family˼hildren/reproduction. I did not think it was too much work, although we ended up missing one of the classes and only had to write 2 short papers instead of the usual 3.
Well this was an interesting course, I was a bit disappointed in the lack of actual content pertaining to reproduction or birth. Quite a bit of the content was about marriage and kinship ties and I was hoping there would be a bit more on the medical side of anthropology and more on the evolution of childbirth.
This three hour class was really hard for me to get through. The discussion never flowed well enough for me to catch on. We had to read about four books. The whole grade depended on the final research paper which did not have a clear outline. The professor did make an effort to assist in formulating a good topic for the final paper. However, I found her to be very critical of ideas brought up in class that made it difficult for me to feel included or willing to participate.
The content of this course has the potential to be really interesting, but because of the professor and the way it's taught, it feels like a waste of time. You can take this if you need it for anthro major - it's not too much work - but I would not recommend it. Also, professor makes racist microaggressions in class.
Wonderful professor and wonderful reading assignments

Comments
This is not a blow off class! The readings are dense and time consuming and the papers take careful detailed attention, but this class is SO worth it. So wildly interesting and though provoking. Professor Partridge is a delight. She is kind and caring and wants her students to learn and understand. She is very helpful in office hours when it comes to the papers. She is a relatively easy grader but the papers require use of primary sources as well as class texts. Learning about health based social movements was so interesting and the discussions she facilitated in class were as well.
This was such a good class. Amy is such a good instructor and she put together a fascinating set of course materials that created a great theoretical and historical sense of health activism. I loved going to class each day and would highly recommend taking a class with Amy!
I loved this class. I always felt challenged but that I could ask questions when I didn't understand something. Sometimes there was a lot of material to read or watch before the next class, but it was never busy work. Every assignment we had helped us in some way to understand the material further. Professor Partridge is really amazing and I learned so much in this class.
This course was super interesting and enjoyable. Amy did a fantastic job of presenting students with stimulating research and encouraging discussion during class.
This course is extremely eye-opening and interesting, and it and truly helps you apply analytical frameworks in a very engaging way.
Decent amount of reading, but Partridge picked a lot of great pieces that are still relevant. Good class to take if you're interested in public health, premed with a gender studies twist.
