Comments
Prof. Davis shows lots of enthusiasm for what he teaches in this class, which influences the rest of the class as a whole. He properly preps students in filmography terms that are initially unfamiliar to us all and also encourages us to provide any sort of perspective of the films watched as assignments during class. I definitely would recommend taking a class with Professor Davis to any student interested in watching films!
This was an interesting course, looking at gender and sexuality and cinematography. I learned a lot about looking at a film beyond the plot and storyline. Also just learning about how the filmmaking plays into the storyline.
I really enjoyed this class. The movies were interesting to watch and then hear more about in class.
i loved this class. it made me think so different about the themes of gender and sexuality and also about how to watch films in general. take this class if you want to really improve your writing and have it be assessed by a professor who really gives amazing feedback and suggestions. he was a great person and professor
This course was great! Professor Davis is a funny (if a bit awkward - in a good way), engaging, and excited professor who will meet his students where they are at in terms of background knowledge. Some of the films were a bit long, but overall the workload was not intense, and Professor Davis provided great feedback on every assignment.
I really enjoyed the course. The teacher was great. The way he incorparated certain thoughts about movies were great. It was an open and fun course and i loves it.
This was a super cool seminar. Professor Davis choose cool movies to watch and discuss and brought in relevant and interesting guest speakers.
Good class that helped me learn a lot about movies and there was a lot of freedom to pick what movie you wanted to write about for your papers. The professor was also very helpful with explaining what he wanted to see in his papers.
The course was very interesting, we watched movies that focused on the theme of the seminar, gender and sexuality. Some were more popular like moonlight and lady bird but others were something I probably would never have seen if not for this class. Class time consisted of discussing the movies and close scene analysis. You have to watch at least one, if not, two movies a week.
Nick Davis is a phenomenal teacher. He truly cares about his students, offers valuable feedback, and organizes each lesson so that its an immersing experience for every student. Best teacher I've had at NU so far. This class is a decent amount of work (one/ two films every week and some writing assignments) but its worth it!!! IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING TAKING THIS COURSE/ ANY COURSE WITH DAVIS DO IT. I had no experience with analyzing films-I hardly even watched films- and I was pretty okay at writing, but this course has helped me gain so much.
Great selection of films, Professor Davis is a great facilitator of discussion and provides really interesting background information for the films as well. And the papers were fairly interesting to write.
Professor Davis seems to care and genuinely be interested in his students. However it gets to the point where participating in discussion becomes uncomfortable. He won't let people freely talk without going on a long response, commenting about what the person just said. I think he has good intentions but it makes class seem unnatural to participate in. Movies were interesting but he said he was going to focus a lot on masculinity since apparently NU students don't get offered that many classes. I think I would prefer him to start a different class on that topic because most of us hadn't taken a gender class before so I felt like he was taking other people's ideas and putting it on first year students. Rather I would've like a greater survey of movies. We didn't get to movies about women until later in the class. Overall it's a good class if you're interested in analyzing films, not just watching them for fun.

Comments
I cannot stress how much I loved this course. The material was extremely interesting and really pertinent to issues that still exist today. The workload was definitely manageable, and the readings were enjoyable so it didn't always feel like work. This is a really good course as a freshman seminar, as it eases you into what taking humanities classes at Northwestern is like. The papers were all extremely manageable (3 papers 3-5 pages, one final paper) and the ability to rewrite them makes you a better writer. Dr. Partridge truly cares about the material she teaches and truly cares about how her students feel in her class.
The most important part of this course was actually attending the seminars--the discussions were really helpful and beneficial to learning about the course content. The readings were really bulky, so don't fall behind on them.
I think something very important for this course is to keep up with the readings because there is a lot, and if you fall behind, it's hard to contribute to discussions. Amy's discussions are pretty engaging and did change how I viewed women's health and feminism in general.
Very long lectures- would think this class is somewhat discussion centered because of the small amount of people in it, but hardly ever were there times to discuss ideas (even the readings) with others. Not only did the class not discuss the readings but a lot of the readings were never brought up even by Amy. Was kind of frustrating considering the extensiveness of some of the readings you have to do. Overall Amy is very nice and helpful if you go to her, but in class can sort of drag by because tangents occur every single class. Amy is incredible though and was very supportive and helpful for the transition into college!
Overall, this is an interesting course, however, I do not feel like I learned as much about the women's health movement as I would have liked to, as often times, the content of this course was mostly geared towards fitting a specific feminist narrative, rather than considering all perspectives involved. Its an interesting topic, but is taught only looking at the feminist perspective, without actually considering the practicality of any other sides involved.
Great class, very interesting material, but the professor never stopped talking. It was basically a monologue and ever so often she would ask the class a question, but no no one would answer because it would take her at least ten minutes to ask a question. We also did not discuss most of the readings that we did, which is kind of frustrating. But the material is great and the assignments are pretty fun to write.
I really loved this course. The readings, films, and topics were super interesting. I liked how what we learned was connected to current issues and hot-button topics today. This class inspired me to switch my major to Gender Studies!
okay course, lots of reading and papers were graded a little harder than expected. thought this class would be more of a discussion but mostly just Amy talking and a few comments from the few who usually speak in class
This course wasn't too bad you have to attend every class as that is the only way you will gain any information. The lectures are pretty boring but the professor is really nice. There are 3 short papers (3-4 pages) and then one final paper. The grading is tough but you can resubmit assignments to get points back.
Discussions were interesting, but sometimes prolonged to the extent I had no idea what we were even talking about anymore. You really have to focus for the whole class or else you will fall behind really easily. All the writing assignments were back loaded into the last few weeks of the class which was stressful around finals time. You really need to stay on top of your work in order to "stay on the bus and not get crushed by the next one".

Comments
An extremely interesting and fun course to take for a distro that is a bit heavy on reading, but is not too time-consuming. The papers push you to think critically so they can be challenging, but the class prepares you very well to take on these topics.
This is one of the best classes I have taken at NU. Carrillo made me smile every day. I planned on dropping this class because it doesn't fulfill any requirements for me, but every class I went to was so satisfying that I could not let myself drop it.
This is a really interesting course and Professor Carillo is a good lecturer; it's somewhat challenging but overall worth it
I feel like I have a comprehensive understanding of the history of human sexuality, which is awesome.
This course is AWESOME- by far my favorite class I have taken at Northwestern. The material is super interesting and the professor is super cool and passionate about the topics taught in class.
It was very good. I liked that my attention was grabbed in every lecture. Unfiltered
Very interesting class. highly recommended. you will learn a lot about sexuality in this course. Professor carrillo fuse various perspectives and schools of thoughts together without confusing one perspective with another. contents are interesting. though you have to read a lot readings for that class, most readings are fun and even mind-blowing. good course to take if you want to see what gndr study is like
The topics covered were super compelling and interesting, but sometimes the assigned reading could be way too overwhelming.
The course is great and well-structured. It consists of one midterm and two essays, all of which are manageable if you review the major aspects of each sociologist you discuss in class and their respective reading assignments.
The class is named Sexuality and Society, yet there was ONE reading on queer female sexuality in the entire class. Often during class Professor Carrillo (who is a great instructor) would make claims about homosexual identity or sexuality using research that exclusively talked about gay men. I found this bias and general lack of content on queer female sexuality incredibly disappointing and uncomfortable at times.
weekly discussion questions can be annoying but lectures are interesting and fun. lots of reading and you have to do them. go to lectures!
I found the course very interesting and relevant to modern society. I would highly recommend the course.
Amazing class, Professor Carrillo was a great instructor and the course material was very interesting, work wasn't ridiculously tough but readings could be a bit dense at some points. Essays and test are manageable as long as you allocate time well.
The professor absolutely ROCKED this class. It was one of the most fun and engaging classes that I have had at Northwestern. Considering it was a larger sized lecture, we still had discussions during class that helped me to keep engaged.The readings were very insightful but at the same time there were too many to keep up with.
The lectures were engaging and for the most part the materials felt relevant.
Carrillo is THE BEST. He truly cares that we’re learning and engaged and happy. The course material is very interesting although I wish we spent more time studying sexual identities. I came away with a much deeper understanding of sexuality, but no “answers” because there are none. But it’s definitely helped me reflect on my own sexuality and question all the scripts I’ve been told my whole life. It’s changed the way I think and I am so grateful. The course isn’t that difficult and is truly worth it.
This class is such a good elective to take! It's so so interesting and brings up aspects of sexuality I had never even thought about. Carillo is so energetic and keeps the lectures interesting.
This was my first gender studies class at Northwestern. I am an engineer and I took the class because I was interested in this topic. I thought this class was really great and I enjoyed it a lot. From Professor Carrillo's general care and interest in this class to the supportive TAs, I felt this that class made me comfortable around a topic that I knew little about. I learned a lot because we covered a lot of topics. The readings can be a lot, but in class we really break them down and get the main ideas cleared up. The discussion section was sometimes boring but came in handy for reviewing for the midterm and prepping for writing the essays. In general, I think that if you are thinking of taking a gender studies class that this would be a good option.
This class is great. The material keeps you engaged and Carrillo is a great lecturer and an overall wonderful and genuine human being. This class taught me so much about sexuality and the ways in which it operates in society. I'm glad I took this course. For those of you being financially conscious of courses and course materials--all you need is a clicker subscription in this class. All of the readings are online thanks to Carrillo.
TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HECTOR. He's the most enthusiastic professor I've ever had, and he's the kind of professor that makes you want to go to lecture. The readings were varied and interesting, and nothing's off the table in this class and discussion. A great intro to gender and sexuality studies if you're pursuing that. Highly recommend.
This is an enjoyable course, although a bit heavy on the readings. Professor Carrillo is great and watching him teach was always a joy, but some aspects of the course were a little overdone/their purpose was not clearly communicated.
If you're debating taking this class then just go for it, especially if you're not a sociology/psych major. A lot to learn about sexuality (not much about sex though; if you take the class you can easily explain the difference ;) ). Carrillo is a fantastic prof, very eager to teach and amazing at explaining stuff. Also authored some of the reading you'll do in the class, which is honestly not that much (I usually did them in 1-2 hours the day before each class).
I went into this class thinking that I was fairly knowledgeable about the subject, but I was surprised by how much I learned. Professor Carillo is an amazing professor, and his lectures are always very engaging and interesting. I really enjoyed the polls he conducted in class. In terms of the discussion section, I think it really varies, depending on which group you get. For the most part, I had a positive experience, but opinions can definitely become very polarized.

Comments
Course is interesting and not that hard. You don't have to do all the readings, just enough to get the discussion questions done and write solid papers. Lectures are interesting and Professor Norton is a very understanding, approachable guy. He wants you to enjoy the subject matter and do well.
This class was really interesting and taught very well.
I took this course as a last second distro, but was surprised by how interesting it was. It changed my way of thinking. It was a lot of reading and the papers were challenging but I learned a lot.
A wonderful survey of issues I knew I was interested in but didn't know much in-depth about, excepting personal experience. Thoroughly enjoyed being challenged.
A lot of reading, super fun interesting lectures
This was a great class. It's organized really well and Professor Norton is so nice and knows how to keep lectures interesting.
This class is very interesting and has a good range of interesting material and videos
There was a lot more reading than I was expecting, and much of it was very dense. That said, Aaron gives really good lectures and you can often get away with reading one out of several readings for each class, or skimming all of them. Overall, there are a lot of very cool discussions about complex ideas relating to sexuality.
Professor Norton is amazing. Having class with him was really fun. People had different opinions and they could voice it without feeling judged. Most of the readings were easy and really interesting.
This is such an incredible course. Professor Norton is an amazing teacher and absolutely hilarious. Its not an easy A, but if you do work and pay attention, its not hard to do well.
It covered a great range of topics from women's issues to racism. There was no issue the course shied away from.
SUCH AN INTERESTING COURSE. Aaron is a very funny and enjoyable lecturer; lots of polls in class; fun music at the beginnings. He knows his information and relays it well. Do the readings each week, they're actually really interesting.
Very interesting. Essays were tough
This course was very interesting and Aaron is a great professor.
This course is great. I learned a lot while still not doing much work. The professor is truly amazing - so funny and knowledgable.
Professor is nice, but his exam questions are not that nice
He does not fully use slides, so if u are a visual learner, it could be hard to catch up his saying
General learning about gender and society, learning a lot, broadening ur perspective on world, yet quite lots of reading
I took this course because I thought it was a distro BUT IT IS NOT A HISTORY DISTRO. Aaron is very funny and sweet, but he could ramble at times. We did polls which needed a clicker˼licker technology which were cool. Both papers were very demanding and mentally taxing to write because of how theoretical they were. Todd was a great TA. CRAZY AMOUNT OF READINGS!!!! Some days had over 60+ pages, and there was NO WAY TO KEEP UP.
A good gender studies intro. The readings are interesting but the overview of sexuality is pretty basic. If you've taken gender studies before/ are LGBT, you will spend a lot of time rolling your eyes. If not, then its a good 101
This course is super interesting! The reading is relatively heavy and a little dense at times, but at other times it is super interesting and a little raunchy! My professor gave excellent lectures, so on occasion I could definitely get by without doing the reading. There is one exam, which you can definitely get a good grade on if you review powerpoints, and two 5-6 page essays.
This is a great class! Aaron is hilarious and an amazing teacher! The readings are super interesting (kinda long) but usually worth it. The two papers are difficult but doable
You'll learn a lot in this class if you haven't had much experience with gender studies before and it's really a lot of fun. My only complaint was that the professor has tailored the course material so that it focuses very heavily on homosexual men; while it's an interesting topic I think the class would be better served by spreading the focus out a bit
Best professor that I had this quarter. Aaron makes class unbelievably fun. All the information that you need for the midterm is from the lectures but the readings are definitely helpful in providing additional details about lecture topics. Discussion sections are thought-provoking. Most material is relevant in today's society. GREAT COURSE
I took this class to see if I was interested in Gender and sexuality studies and was disappointed. The vast majority of the readings˼ontent in the class was focused on/written by men. Professor Norton has a very roundabout lecture style. The prompts for the essays were too broad. We were asked to discuss 5 articles in a 5 page paper which made it virtually impossible to focus on a narrow specific subject and really dig deep into it while still following the prompt.
So informative, Norton is an amazing professor, totally manageable amount of work, and always emotionally and intellectually engaging. Such a wonderful class.
Fantastic class! Aaron is amazing and brought light to so many important topics in such a fun, friendly, and perfectly quirky manner.
I was pretty interested in this class material but then after the in-class midterm which actually had to relate to all the material covered during the first half of the quarter, I lost a lot of interest in the subject, mainly because the rest of the graded assignments were essays only covering one topic. Aaron Norton is such a soft-spoken guy but he is really nice and cares about his students. Really don't have to go to a lot of the classes after the actual midterm in class.
The course overall is super interesting. A really great distro especially when taught by Prof. Norton. My ideas about sexuality were constantly questioned and I was consistently intrigued by the material.
Discussion section was what made this class very worthwhile for me. Though lecture was interesting, I gained so much real world understanding from my TA (V) and the other students in my section. Aaron does a great job of clearing up the reading and presents the points you need to know.
This was a fantastic class! Aaron is an awesome prof, and it was a really effective survey course, considering how easily it could have become unfocused with the massive amount of content covered. It made me think more critically about gender and sexuality, and even though a lot of the topics were not new to me, I found it to be really engaging and learned tons.
In my opinion, this is a great course with a great instructor and great TA's. This course really opened my eyes to the complexities of sexuality as it relates to many aspects of our society that might not always be as straightforward as it may seem. Though some readings were quite long and some of them slightly difficult to grasp at first, Aaron and the TA's really help break it down into simpler terms. Highly recommend this class.
This class really put me out of my comfort zone bc I've never taken a class on this topic before. A lot of reading but not entirely necessary that you do it. In class midterm and two take home essays. If you take this class be ready to feel uncomfortable!
This course was such an eye-opening experience and it was funny and genuine and practical. Aaron Norton is an amazing professor
This course was great! It was always interesting, and Aaron is really invested in the students and making class engaging. You learn a lot about modern issues while still learning about things you didn't know about before. The readings can be a bit long but they're usually interesting.
I really enjoyed this class. I felt like Aaron was able to keep it fresh and keep things current. If something happened over the weekend that would relate to something we learned or are learning, heɽ include it in the next lecture. Definitely a class worth taking if you're interested in learning about multiple forms of sexuality in our own society and societies around the world.
Interesting, low-stress introductory course on sexuality and its interactions with sociology. As an LGBT student I came in having a deeper and different perspective because of my identity which likely left me to get less out of the class than others might have. Still the class had some interesting readings and discussions were informative on hearing about the experiences of others.
The course was super interesting but at times a little too wishy washy for me.
Professor Norton is a wonderful teacher and is very excited and open about the topics in Sexuality in Society. The class looks at a wide range of communities and theoretical frameworks, all of which were presented with engaging articles and lectures.
Prof. Norton is amazing. He provides great readings and explains them very well. He was so fun and a great Prof. to have. Very good teacher as well.
The instruction in this class was always engaging and broke down the readings without over-simplifying.
This course is awesome. It introduced me to more ideas about sexuality in general and how people work in general and the importance of sex in people's lives. The professor is so nice, supportive, and his jokes are pretty good. It was a pleasure to take that class and learn about something that's considered so taboo. I'm sad it's over.
I really enjoyed Prof. Norton's lectures -- he was engaging and thought-provoking, which made me happy to attend the larger courses. The midterm was fair, and the essays allowed deeper engagement with material, so I liked the assessment methods in the course.
Aaron was an incredible professor! This course wasn't too hard, with a discussion section, midterm, and two essays (one of the essays was the final). It was also super interesting.
This course is great! Very interesting content and taught by a very fun professor. I actually enjoyed writing the essays and doing the reading
fantastic course with a great professor. Norton is such a nice person and makes most of the lectures really interesting. readings and class material are all super interesting, a few of the readings were a bit long. midterm is pretty easy and only two essays, which aren't graded too hard.
I thought that the breadth of topics that we covered through different texts provided a comprehensive view of the subject and I found the readings interesting to read. Additionally the papers for this class felt easy to write due to the wealth of information I gained from the course.

Comments
I absolutely loved this seminar-style course. The readings were, for the most part, super engaging and interesting. I would 100% recommend this course. Professor Stokes is the coolest and is also considerate about students' needs. She is always willing to help and responds quickly to emails.
Well... The other options for the "Historical Studies" distro made me want to pull my teeth out with my bare hands. This class wasn't awful, but I wish it were an actual history course. Itɽ definitely not; instead, it's about reading articles at home and discussing in class about their impact or something. Not what I'm interested in, sorry!
Love this course so much, it was honestly v interesting. IT SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO TAKE A TRANS* HISTORY COURSE!!!!
I thought his course was really good, I loved the topic and really enjoyed learning about trans identities throughout history.
Trans history is not Trans studies. I don't feel that this should be in the gender studies department if the faculty is not an adjunt gender studies prof.
This is such an amazing course. I absolutely adore the fact that Northwestern offers classes like this. It's so important, and this class is absolutely fascinating. Also Professor Stokes is a GEM
This was such an important class for me. I hope that Northwestern continues to offer more classes about trans history and trans studies.
I don't feel like I was particularly challenged or enlightened in this class, but it was definitely interesting at times and an overall enjoyable class.
I enjoyed the readings focusing on queer/LGBT life in Paris, focusing on institutionally forgotten or minimised aspects of history
I LOVED this course. Awesome subject matter, interesting professor, fun lectures. Workload was super manageable, my favorite class this quarter.
This course helped me learn about the unspoken and important presence that trans people have had throughout history. It also clarified the terminology that is used today to describe and discuss trans issues, while also acknowledging and displaying the differences in vocabulary because of generational gaps, geography, and other factors. This was also one of the first history courses I've taken, and I was able to explore the Northwestern archives for the first time, look at primary sources, and take a gender studies topic from a historical perspective.
The course was very well structured, pairing academic and historical readings with in course discussion and collaboration. Professor Stokes facilitated thought provoking instruction and did a fantastic job of tailoring the course to our class's needs. There were three short papers and a final project, that allowed for creativity in the form of an art project.
While it is clear that Professor Stokes is amazing and suer knowledgable on this content, her expectations for readings to prepare for class were CRAZY. No one is able to read 100+ pages of dense text between 2 days of class. Also, I feel like I would have gotten a lot more out of the class if it would have been lecture-based instead of discussion-based. We have this amazing professor in front of us and I wanted her to just teach us the material insead of listening to classmates talk about the readings for the entire class period.
This was my first history class and provided an historical approach to transgender studies. I found that the course lacked clearly articulated throughlines/themes, and it was hard to connect the readings to the scholarship we read.

Have you ever heard of a course named this before? NO, because nu doesn't offer enough intersectional courses!!! take it regardless of your background to be mindblown and learn about actual us history, cry a lil, get mad, etc. take advantage of the research paper (which is most of your grade) to write about something you are actually interested in!! and START EARLY! Professor Yuh is one of the smartest coolest profs at this school so you better do this
Professor Yuh is an insightful instructor and historian that presents history in an interesting and engaging way. I'm someone who hasn't liked history classes in the class, and this was perfect. Never was I bored or overwhelmed, and I really enjoyed the class discussions.
The class is structured like a lecture for classes, and then a discussion every other class. It's best to enter the class with a decent background in world history or asian-american history, as it brings more to the table for discussion. There were a lot of awkward pauses in class where Yuh would ask a question and no one would be able to answer.
This was a good introduction to Asian American women throughout American history. Yuh is a great professor who clearly is extremely well-versed in this topic. She facilitates discussion well in class and constantly encourages students to attend˼ommunicate with her through office hours. Iɽ say the class had a bit too much group discussion for my own taste (much prefer listening to her lecture), but overall I enjoyed being in class and it was very stimulating material. I also found some of the readings to be a bit dry — we did a lot of anthology reading, while I thought the other resources she offered were much more thought-provoking and engaging.
This class opened up my understanding of history beyond what I could have imagined
Loved it
Yuh could do a little better with organization of the course but the material and inesteuxrion was really valuable! Only a few assignments but she grades hard so they all count.
Yuh is really cool and the weekly readings aren't much. Three easy enough to do response papers and a 10 page final of your subject choice. Felt personal and would recommend.
Dr. Yuh is PHENOMENAL. She's extremely knowledgeable and very willing to work with students on assignments, etc. She knows what she's talking about, and gave a good survey of Asian American women from East and South East Asia. We very briefly touched on South Asian women, but the focus is on Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Japan. Dr. Yuh's academic work is also on Korea. The class was a little boring at times because it was done as small groups rather than lecture˽iscussion style, but the work generally was productive and helpful.
much reading please do it though it is super awkward to be the only person in class who contributes to discussion and Yuh is such an important Asian American scholar do not take her for granted
