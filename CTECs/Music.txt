Comments
Prof. Hudson made things fun and I thought he had a good approach to teaching theory. The class gets kinda boring as you just go through species after species of counterpoint with no breaks or detours in the curriculum but it's fine and the expectations are, for the most part, super reasonable.
This class is fantastic, I hear all the teachers were great and the evaluations are as clear cut as can be. They really encourage you to do well.

It's a required class, but Cline is a good professor and is engaging.
This course taught us what we needed to know and stayed engaging.
This course was overall a really great music theory class.

Comments
Not a lot of work outside of class, lots of workshopping and group work in class... Dr. P was really helpful
Nice hands on approach.
It is pretty cool, ultimately, that I was able to compose a basic canon with embellishments at the end. It found it pretty exciting.
I love this class and I have learned so much in it.
I never knew much about music theory before taking this course so it was really interesting to relate it back to playing my instrument. Dr. P. is a very genuine and awesome teacher. She really cares about her students a lot and is passionate about teaching. she makes what would otherwise be a very boring course, very interesting!
This is a class that teaches you the building blocks of music which will help you with any music related degree, not just performance or education.
Loved it
I really enjoyed this course. The skills test helped me identify the intervals and stuff very fast so I don't have to count out the steps. It also went over canons and counterpoint.

Comments
I'm really glad that this course went more in-depth as to how to write counterpoint
As this is Theory I, things aren't particularly hard yet. The things we learned were at a pace that required no outside studying. Perfectly fine class.
The instructions were clear and the assignments were simple and straightforward as well.
I loved this course; Sean Yeh is the best. He's extremely knowledgeable and made the class enjoyable. However, he may not be able to properly get a point across every now and then.
This course is good at starting at the fundamentals and then expanding into other ideas. This adds another dimension to the music we play.
This course was adequate in increasing my knowledge of music theory.
I found the first few weeks to be way too easy, but later on it began to be a little bit more challenging. Even still, I would have liked the course to move faster through the material.
The class was well structured in a way that moved quickly enough, but also provided time to ask questions and absorb the material.

Comments
I love how much practice we do together
A highly student-orientated teaching approach is employed in this class. Concepts are taught, and students are given ample time to practice in class activities. There is also feedback given in class for homework and class assignments⾬tivities, which helps for the quick absorption of theory concepts. Because of that, students need not study extensively for class assessments, because the concepts are well-taught and drilled during class hours.
I really wanted to learn the "rules" of music, and this was perfect for that!
We learned about species counterpoint writing. The transition between topics are smooth and you don't need to spend a lot of time on it.

Comments
Several rules such as the note-to-note writing and factors of beautiful melodic lines are important for me to understand 16th century music better.
I loved this class. It was a very fair amount of work for a half credit class. Kenn is very engaging and seems to enjoy theory and teaching. At the beginning of the quarter, I was so bored with two voices and I didn't see any applications. But, once we got into 3 voices, things became more interesting and my compositions started to sound like music. I'm also just a theory nerd, so that's part of the reason I liked this class so much.
I truly loved all aspects of this class. The inside and outside of class work was very doable yet challenging. The projects and compositions or fun and I felt that I learned a lot from doing them. I was surprised by the depth of the quality of education at the professor provided.
Kenn Kumpf makes this counterpoint something that I legitimately wanted to learn more about, and he presents the material in a fun and interesting way. He is clearly committed to this class, and it's almost hard to imagine him doing anything else.
This course was a challenge but a lot of fun.
Although theory isn't my favorite class, I have learned to appreciate it and had lots of fun writing my own compositions.
I felt satisfied to learn counterpoint because I feel that it did have significance in my interpretation of music
Really fun and interesting difficult but well explained
Wouldn't be good if not very interested because of all the work but if are then really enjoy
good instructor. hope he could emphasize more on what's important and what's not. sometimes the lines are pretty blurry
Learn how to do counterpoint and get good at it!

Comments
Rosenberg is very knowledgeable and an engaging lecturer. He tells you exactly what he wants on exams and papers. Also he wants everyone to succeed
Rosenberg is a very good lecturer - he manages to captivate his students with his calm voice and extraordinary demonstrations of concepts at the piano. I enjoyed the topics of his class very much, and feel that this will probable be the most lax course out of the music history sequence.
This class was one of the least stimulating course I have taken at Northwestern. Prof. Rosenberg's lectures were often filled with self-serving intellectual questionings without any clear point or drawn historical narrative.
Unfortunately, I did not find that I was introduced to many new topics in this course -- it focused mainly on repertoire, and I was already familiar with the majority of what was covered. I wish that the course had focused more on compositional trends and historical events that occurred during the period.
Professor Rosenberg is excellent! Workload is very light and grading system is fair.
When Rosenberg talks, I enter another dimension. Stingy with the lecture notes though.
Rosenberg is an utterly lovely man. He provides a very fresh spin on historical concepts and always entertains as well as educates.
Filled with asinine assessments designed to test how well you can memorize and promptly forget information. Deeply irritating grading policies (eg. taking 10% off of virtually everyone in the class for double spacing an assignment where we were not told to single space), and not enough depth in any of the content to actually be interesting.
I felt that I learned very little in this course. The fact that we were quizzed on things like Chicago Citations and Musical Catalogues didn't help at all.
Professor Rosenberg is definitely a great professor. Of course, the material itself is pretty dry and boring, but he makes the class bearable. The grade distribution is pretty clear, and it's definitely an almost guaranteed A- or A if you study for the quizzes. He gives you what to study for the quizzes, so make sure you study those. The worst part of this entire course is the final research paper which is 8-10 pages. Unfortunately, we didn't really get any guidance on the paper. It's only worth 15% of our grade, but still, it would have been nice to have a bit more guidance on choosing our topics or for research. The final is take-home, and you can pretty much answer all of the questions as long as you do some of the readings and pay marginal attention in class.
Very manageable course - the more notes you take in class the easier the assignments will be.

Comments
This class wasn't bad - take it with Rosenberg instead of new Talle if you want less work. Rosenbeg is a gem and he really tells a story in his lectures. He is understanding and not too demanding. But the TA..... don't even get me started. She is obsessed with having the class pass around a written attendance sheet (already this idea is very "high school") and honestly this interrupts the class so much as people have to stand up to pass it around and then eventualy pass the sheet back to her. What year are we in? There are plenty of online attendance websites.
Take with Rosenberg!! Minimal work + engaging lectures.
On the final he picked out some very specific details from lecture (I take detailed notes generally and even I didn't have some of them) so might be good to be aware of that. I managed fine with the internet's help, though (it's a take home)
Easiest class you will take in bienen in the worst way
music of the long 18th century
This class was a good mix of relaxed, manageable assignments with stimulating, interesting lecture
The professor is not very specific about when he is going on a tangent and when he is talking about information that is in the curriculum. It can be confusing
The course accomplished everything it possibly could have for a 10 week course covering a huge section of Western music history.
Rosenberg often has interesting things to say in lecture, but his delivery isn't very exciting. Some people listen intently, and some people can't stay awake while he's talking. His lectures flow well, but he often spends a lot of time saying redundant or unnecessary things.
This course was SO dry. It was difficult for me to connect to⿞velop any interest in the course content.
Professor Rosenberg is super approachable and responsive to emails. The class consists of short quizzes, short writing assignments, one research paper, and a take-home final. The work is not overwhelming as long as you start early enough on the research paper.

Comments
The class is very structured so I really liked it. There are weekly listening quiz which can get VERY HARD.
It was really nice to have all the lectures so organized and easy for me to follow. Studying for assessments was pretty straightforward thanks to Professor Talle.
It was ok
Good course; Talle did a good job condensing two centuries into one quarter. The readings and listenings are well-organized and make sense, there are just so many of them. Lectures were great
Great professor, very interesting lectures.
This definitely felt like the first year Talle taught this class (there were more than a few kinks) but he is a really great lecturer and picks interesting topics to discuss. Definitely worth taking over the other teacher.
I really enjoyed this class although there is a lot of work to do. I learned a lot in this class and I enjoyed the lecture overall. It is very interesting to see how pieces that are equally famous during the time ends up differently now. Just make sure you don't fall behind on the reading.
I would have liked to focus more on instrumental music rather than opera, since we did a lot of opera. I was mostly interested in the stories and the lives of the composers we come across all the time in our industries, but I found myself most concerned with the listening quizzes. I did learn a lot from listening, even with the overwhelming amount we had to do, but I still would have liked to learn more about the historical influences on certain instrumental composers.
Professor Talle is an extremely passionate teacher, always trying to engage students through added humor and tangents. He truly cares about them and is always trying to improve the class structure
Expect a listening and analysis course not a history course.
The amount of reading and listening really is a lot, but the work you are putting in really does help you learn. If you do not put in the time, however, it is really easy to fall behind and get bad grades on quizzes. Everything that appears on quizzes and tests are things that we clearly went over or were indicated that they are things we should know about. No surprises.

Comments
This course emphasizes lifestyle techniques that will help in movement, being stationary, and in any activity we pursue. The unnecessary tensions are recognized and we learn to "let go" of those tensions, bringing our body into a more correct alignment for more effective function. This technique is also helpful for performing.
Very low key but also didn't learn anything that helped me improve my performance which is disappointing.

Comments
I noticed some improvement in my sense of pitch and intonation, but I felt the course was very unstructured. There were no clearly defined units or skills we were working on, and each class seemed to be a random assortment of exercises. It would be nice to have clearly defined objectives and skills so that the exercises we did in class were directly applicable to material included on the examinations.
Because learning something like aural skills just requires practice, class time was often a drag, since concepts would just be repeated. At the same time, however, the concepts can be difficult to actually learn. The class setting is simply not conducive to the subject, although there is likely no better way. Any progress I made was mainly through individual instruction.
Niki is very disorganized and ineffective as a teacher. She is a nice person though
This course is clearly a well-established and organized class on the whole and the assignments and performance videos were usually challenging but helpful. However my teacher was extremely unqualified to teach this class. She often complained of getting little sleep and being stressed out by her own work - this inability to balance her own life led to her being extremely disorganized during class and she would constantly be unable to play diction examples correctly or consistently for us, leading to a lot of confusion. As long as you have a good TA this class is excellent - despite having a disorganized teacher I still learned and improved my solfege singing and aural skills a great deal just through all the exercises we do in class every day.
I really don't understand why the voice majors aren't in a separate aural skills class.
I know I learned because I have a much better ear now, but the class felt pretty repetitive. I know repetition is necessary in ear training, but it was hard to stay interested.
It wasn't the most pleasant of courses; not particularly organized and not particularly engaging. The work was necessary and I feel that my ear improved over the quarter, but not in the most efficient of ways.

Comments
It was fine. This class is a necessary evil, and the department makes it bearable. I do wish theyɽ tie the exercises to real-world situations,though.
learned a lot! but was also super challenging. had lots of spots where I didn't know how to figure out by myself but the student teachers also gave tutoring sessions to help out
Aural skills is sort of a necessary evil-- although I enjoyed it, it doesn't come naturally for everyone and can involve a bit of outside preparation for the performance checks.
This section (With Arrellin) started out as extremely frustrating. He was unclear on instructions and expectations, and the class itself was boring. However, as the quarter got on and the material got more difficult, it was clear that I had improved a lot to handle the new material. Arrellin isn't a great teacher but he is a nice guy, and a lot better than some of the other aural skills TAs from what I've heard. I always felt underprepared for performance checks, and in order to prepare myself I had to practice out of class, which he didn't necessarily give us tools on how to do.

Comments
Made Aural skills an approachable subject. Definitely study outside of class though if you really want to improve. Some of the material presented in class is easier than what comes up on the test. Never thought I would be where I am. Aural Skills!!!
It's really a necessary subject
Rhythm way way easier than dictation and the like wish former moved faster and latter slower so annoying but just me I realize
I am a better at aural skills because of this course.
It was challenging in that it is difficult to improve if you are inherently a bad singer.
I wanted to get better at ear training, and being able to hear songs and transcribe them, both of which I have definitely improved upon!

Comments
Extremely difficult.
This course is very useful for anyone who plans to remain involved with music in the future. Whether you are a member of a symphony orchestra or the backing band for a pop singer, the ability to hear melodies and then play them on your instrument is invaluable, and this course teaches you how to do exactly that.

This course has helped me improve my abilities to apply my ear training to my instrument.
It's a necessary evil and not the most fun, but Hudson makes it more than bearable. Great teacher!
I really do not like this class, Mr. Hudson is a really nice guy but the class sucks, I can't sing and I don't know solfege well enough to get by
This course really helped to improve all of my aural skills. Andy is a really fantastic teacher and is very willing to take time to help people improve.

Comments
The course has demonstrated the being a musician isn't only about how well you play your instrument, but also how well your listening skills are.
I thought this course was very good, and taught well by a TA that was very engaged in the material and helping the students learn.
Very hard
I enjoyed it a lot because it was very helpful.

Comments
This class helped keep my aural skills in check. We were always working on sight-reading, dictation, and learning concepts that are sometimes mentioned in theory.
I learned a lot and this course covered a lot of material. I appreciate the practice materials posted on canvas, but I think much more practice was needed for my skills to be up to par for the exams. I also feel that there should be some sort of cumulative guide outlining what we should know. This has been provided for music theory exams in the past and I find it so helpful because aural skills has gone on for so many quarters up until this point that it is genuinely hard to keep track.

Comments
This class decreased my sight-singing abilities in terms of just being able to produce the pitch of the notes on the page. Before I took it, I was able to sight sing anything using perfect pitch, but thinking of solfege, modulation, and intervalic melodies messed with my skills. It is not by any means my TA's doing since she was just teaching the course, but the course structure must be re-done from the foundation.
Alex makes the class interesting.

I think it's either you get it or don't. But with hard work anyone can probably do well, and there is always support.
It was ok
very useful course, but I'm bitter that my grade is so low even though I put in so much time into this half credit class. Very glad I am in this, but I wish Carter was more lenient with grading

Comments
Not a bad class as long as you don't take with Liza. While she is a very sweet person, her teaching made this class a much more frustrating experience than it needed to be. 
She had trouble explaining theory concepts and often didn't realize she made a mistake (for example, teaching a misspelled chord) until someone points it out. She often would not correct the class when we sing a wrong note while arpeggiating a chord or sight-singing unless someone questions it. She regularly messed up chords in the harmonic dictations and would have to restart each play-through. She had a hard time keeping tempo while playing melodic and rhythmic dictations on the piano. This was so bad on the final that even though she gave us 2 extra listens on top of the normal 6 times, most if not all of the class still had no idea where each measure began and what rhythm she was attempting to play. Even though she was very nice and very accommodating about performance check times, it was still an extremely frustrating quarter.

Comments
This course does an adequate job of teaching the basic skills of what we're supposed to learn. I think it would be useful to just do more singing. I suppose sightsinging is very useful for me, and I would like more practice in singing complex harmonies and challenging aural examples.
Having aural skills is something I think is important for a musician but I don't think this class facilitates improving these skills well
It's fine. I can't say the class was especially engaging, but I learned what I needed to learn.
Dr. Carter is a nice man. Consistent and fair, and for the most part will not waste your time. Reinhart's curriculum is brutally ineffective, however.
Carter is much better than a lot of TAs but you have to be sure to go out of your way to find what you need to work on because a lot of class time could be better spent being in a practice room doing exercises by yourself, not in pairs
Good class with a lot of different activities to focus on improving skills.
Dr. Carter does a fine job of teaching a frustrating curriculum imposed by the department. We've now left the realm of usefulness and are into a land of frustration, angst, and overall monotony. We don't have a choice not to take this though, so what's there to say? I wish there was more sight singing in class.
This course is fine and you have to take it
I thought my teacher was great and responsive, he was very knowledgeable and cares a lot about his students' success in the course, but I am not entirely sure about how much this class is needed for me to succeed as a musician in the real world.
I found this course to be mostly challenging although I did not always feel intellectually challenged in class particularly. The homework and material itself was challenging enough.
I feel like I've gotten more adept at pitch identification and rhythmic and melodic dictations, however harmonic dictations are a dirty gnarly beast that can be skewered with a hot iron.
Some people are just naturally better at aural skills and its hard to catch up because you can't really control what you hear but there's a little part that you have control over like the prepared stuff and learning the possibilities of chord progressions

Comments
Aurals skills is very difficult, but Joan is definitely the best teacher for the subject. He is funny and helpful and wants to see his students succeed.
Aural skills is totally brutal and everything you get out of it is a result of what you put into it. RIP my GPA.
