Comments
I loved the course, I learned a ton about the spanish language and culture. I'm still kinda shitty at spanish but it was fun regardless.
Professor Amorese was the best! We reviewed vocab and grammar during class in partner activities which was helpful in solidifying the grammar/vocab we learned from the homework assignments. We did have a quiz almost every week but I preferred that because it gave me a chance to review the information and also have more grades besides just the 2 tests, compositions, and homework.
The course was a good one, in which we tried to focus on speaking the language as the best way to learn it.
I really enjoyed the course and feel prepared to move to the next level.
I didn't expect to learn so much Spanish in such a short period of time, especially when I had never studied the language before. Classes do move very fast and its important to try and keep on top of vocabulary. Profesora Amorese is very enthusiastic and made coming to class enjoyable. However, I do feel that she is a pretty harsh grader compared to what my friends have said about their professors in other 101 classes.
I was not looking forward to taking Spanish, but the class was still somewhat interesting because we didn't purely focus on vocab and grammar. Sometimes the homework assignments felt more like busy work, but most of them helped me be prepared for class and understand the material.
First, this course is very good and I would highly recommend it to a new Spanish student. If you have any Spanish background however, it will probably be all review. Professor Amorese is very passionate about Spanish and is very good at communicating ideas, assigning relevant work, and designing tests that assess acquired skills. Quizes are frequent, but helpful in keeping the whole class at the same level.
It's a lot of learning Spanish outside of class and sometimes it does get very frustrating. But professor Amorese is extremely understanding and is a great teacher with a lot of enthusiasm.
I loved this course!
This was overall a great course. It was very introductory, but that was helpful to me since I had never taken Spanish before. The workload wasn't too much, but it was just enough for me to feel like I was actually learning valuable language skills. If you are at all considering learning Spanish, take this class, and take it with Amorese!
This course required a lot of small assignments outside of class because we spent most of class speaking. We also took several quizzes throughout the quarter. We covered a lot of content in a short amount of time. It was a lot of work, but we really learned a lot. If you can, take this course with Professor Amorese. She is a tough grader, but she is very enthusiastic and made the class more fun!
I really enjoyed this course because it wasn't too challenging, but we learned a lot.
This was a great introductory course for starting out in the Spanish language! Professor Amorese was energetic and very helpful when any material was confusing. As long as you stay on top of the homework and take time to practice the vocabulary and grammar concepts, this class was not too hard.

Comments
I enjoyed this course a lot. Professor Colom-Mena was witty and fun to talk with. He was really good at leading the discussion in class and gave us helpful worksheets that really boosted our knowledge while also giving us cultural information. What I did not like was the Pearson MySpanishLab work, which felt like a waste of time. It was not helpful at all in my mastering of material. Professor Colom-Mena was not a fan of it either, but we had to do it, because the Spanish department makes us. Buying the access code feels like a waste of $150.
The teacher is very knowledgeable of the language, so he taught without the book most of the time, which helped the class learn more.
I adored this course because of the fact that my professor, Joel Colom-Mena, structured the class to be very conversation oriented. I feel as though I am leaving with a comfort with speaking Spanish beyond that of a beginner.
Study regularly.
It was good.
I loved this class. It was great because the professor created an environment that got all students excited about Spanish and made us learn the language rather than reading from a book.
I loved taking this course. If you can take it with Professor Colom please do! He was an amazing instructor.
This was my favorite class of the quarter and the only class that did not fill me with crippling dread and depression when I thought about it. It helps that I am taking Spanish because I want to and not as a language requirement, but this was an incredible experience.

Comments
This was a fantastic course! You learn so much about Spanish history, culture, and contemporary life. The course material was very engaging and thorough, as it's a combination of modules, articles, short videos, and films. The class was very comprehensive. We discussed course material, but also had plentiful conversations and debates comparing Spain to the U.S. Reyes is a fantastic instructor who deeply cares about the subject, and she knows how to engage the class.The best part of the course are the mesas redondas. These are discussions with 4-5 classmates about the films you watch for the course (there are 2). This was a great way to practice speaking skills in a relaxed environment.
You'll learn a lot about Spanish history and present-day issues in the country; be prepared to speak Spanish constantly and not care if you mess up! Reyes is a fun, theatrical and encouraging professor who really wants you to succeed. The class itself is pretty easy; make sure to do the homework or you'll let your classmates down. There's no place to hide if you don't know what you're talking about.
There was a lot of busy-work to do at home, but class was very interesting and engaging.
I liked this class a lot. Didn't focus on the language or grammar of spanish very much but learned a lot of interesting stuff about Spain as a country
It was an excellent style for learning a language. Very engaging and participation based. The class had a surprising amount of homework, more than I expected.

Comments
Really fun course! Not too hard, as the only work is to read the book. Tests weren't too bad, just focus on the passages discussed in class. The professor is really knowledgeable on the book. Class got dry at times since it really is just the professor lecturing for 50 minutes, and attendance is mandatory, but it's not hard at all.
Professor Fernandez-Morera has a lot of knowledge on the content and DQ itself is a very interesting/humorous read. But because the class is highly reading based, it becomes very stressful if you fall behind on readings, which is easy to happen after the first midterm when the readings pick up. I would take this class if you have some time in your schedule. Overall a good class.
This course is a good lesson in time-management! You only need one 1000+ page book for this class. There's a midterm, a final, and weekly discussion sections. We were allowed to take home the essay portion of the final and complete quick quote identification during the exam time. Lecture is fine. It can be a little early for some (10am) and the professor speaks softly, so you might lose focus easily, but other than that, two thumbs up. Don Quixote is extremely interesting and an easy read. Be sure to keep up with the reading guide or be ahead. It's too easy to skip one day and end up falling behind.
i really liked the book, and the class is totally manageable.
This class provided an overview of Don Quixote and several possible interpretations.
I felt like the material and professor were really interesting but the way the class was taught didn’t really reflect that.
reading. so much.
I was really eager to come in and learn further about a book that I've known and loved for so long, but there seemed to be little to no enthusiasm from the other students, and sometimes the professor himself.
TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! this class is perfect: EASY and INTERESTING. I've always wanted to read Don Quixote because its a classic and everyone should read it, but i know that if i tried to read it on my own i wouldn't have appreciated it as much as i do now that I've been taught Don Quixote in a class setting. this class is super easy and low key, only homework is reading Don Quixote and there is 1 easy midterm and a final that is mostly take home. it's clear that the professor is passionate about Cervantes' works and Don Quixote, but he is a little hard to understand. you have to go to class to succeed.
GREAT class! The professor is really enthusiastic about Don Quixote and I love the book because of his insight. If you ever thought about reading Don Quixote, I would STRONGLY recommend this class because it will illuminate way more than you might have picked up on just reading by yourself.
The class discussions and lectures were informative but rather dry. If you want to specifically learn about Cervantes and Don Quijote, then this is a great class, but if you are looking for a distro and have no prior interest in Don Quijote, you may want to look elsewhere.

Great lit class if you're interested in Latino Studies. I really enjoyed all of the pieces that were chosen for this class which helped understand latinos in the US and latino literature as a literary cannon.
This class is really easy, at least the way Professor Aparicio teaches it a lot of the books are repetitive, and kind of about the same thing. TA Maria is really great, she writes extensive commentary on all of the short papers, does her best to hand these back in a timely fashion so we can apply her notes to are next paper and is a really fair grader. I think a big problem I had with Professor Aparicio was that she didn't really create an environment where people were comfortable to share their reactions to the material, especially not students who were non-Latino˺. Sometimes she would respond to non-Latino˺ students' comments as though to suggest that they were not warranted to make observations about this literature, or that they were generalizing. Of course these kinds of comments are going to be generalizations; it is understood even of social science research that because it requires the compilation of several specific and variant cases into one analyses, the conclusions drawn are generalizations, and can contradict personal experience. I also think its inappropriate to call out specific students in the class for being Latino˺, it really divides the class into people who have "a right" to speak on behalf of the Latinx community and the people who do not, and who therefore should not be commenting on Latino˺ literature. And then she wonders why nobody speaks up in class.
I really enjoyed professor Aparicio's teaching style. She is very accessible to students and allows many interpretations of the text in class discussions. The timing of assignments is not ideal. We did not have a lengthy writing assignment until week 5 and then three more jammed in the last three weeks of the class followed by the final. In general, though, this is a great course, very interesting material, and not overly demanding.
Take this class! I loved it. Did a lot of group work, but the readings were so manageable and so interesting. Aparicio wants to know how you feel about the readings so speak up. Only thing I did not like was how we had Canvas posts due the morning before class day, so definitely no procrastinating allowed.
This is a great class to take. The work load is light however I did wish there was more group discussion so that the class doesn't get boring.
Overall a great course. I was disappointed by a lack of classroom engagement at first, but it didn't take aware from the course material, which was fantastic. Aparicio is an amazing professor and she makes each class enjoyable.
Amazing class. Loved the readings, the professor, and the discussions. Readings are pretty easy to keep up with and are often really interesting to read. Only four 2 page essays, weekly discussion prompts, and a final paper, so it was very manageable.
This was a great course. All of the texts were interesting and Aparicio did a great job of pointing out the most important ideas of every text.
class is not too hard, 4 essays and one final essay 8-10 pages, try to participate in class or you will lose a lot of points, can only miss class twice
I really enjoyed this class! As a Spanish major, I will say I didn't know before that THIS CLASS IS TAUGHT IN ENGLISH! Regardless, we talked a lot about the latino˺/x experience in the US and the stereotypes, myths, and realities associated with that experience. All of the poetry and novels we read were actually really interesting and enjoyable to read. We had responses to the reading due at 9 AM the days before class, which was sometimes stressful but nice because it forces you to get the homework done a few days before class. We had around four 1-2 page papers, where you analyzed the text and a final 8-10 page paper. IF YOU ARE A SPANISH MAJOR, and NOT a native Spanish speaker, it's definitely difficult to translate the discussions you have in class into a paper because apart from the responses all of your essays have to be in Spanish. Just be aware it's very doable but was definitely more difficult
this class was super interesting and made me think a lot more about latinidad and what i means. i liked almost all of the texts that professor aparicio picked.
The lecture was great and really stimulating. I enjoyed reading the texts because they were all very eye opening and offered a different aspect of Latino history. Even if you're not Latino you should take this course because it offers a better understanding of how Latinos have been treated in the U.S., and how literature has been affected.
This was a fun and interesting course, but I felt that the prompts for the papers, which are 10% of your grade each, could have been a lot more specific and that the grading on them was a bit hard to follow, as in sometimes it felt like there was an answer that was expected.

Comments
I didn't learn much in the class, and it was really unorganized. Prof Fernandez-Morera is fun, but I felt lost in his class the entire time, which made the final presentation really difficult.
This class was very disorganized, and I'm not sure what I learned from it. Fernandez-Morera is a nice man, but this class was unpredictable. We had no idea when we would be giving presentations and received little feedback on the work we did do. He is extremely knowledgeable about the topic of medieval Iberia, and I wish I could have learned more in this class.
We didn't exactly stick to the syllabus, and the course was pretty dull at times, but overall it was relatively easy and pushed me to think in new ways about ancient texts.
The material is interesting but the class is pretty disorganized and we fell super far behind schedule. Final presentation (25% of grade) and final paper (50% of grade) topics are assigned by the professor but there's still a good amount of flexibility in what direction you want to take with those, and the shorter response papers are pretty open-ended and you can choose something that interests you.
Fernandez-Morera is the best professor I've had at Northwestern. There are various response papers˿ive minute orals based on the readings. Then, you are assigned a subject for a 20 minute presentation and 8 page paper. Those are the only real assignments of the quarters.
Overall, the assignments are pretty straightforward, this class is bound to fall behind
Interesting course, your grade will be based on 3-5 5 min oral response, a 20 min oral report, and a paper in the end.
Pretty laid-back course. The majority of the class is student-run through presentations and the like, which can be good or bad. The class lost focus midway through the course and struggled to stay on schedule. The final paper still gave an opportunity to examine a topic in-depth, which was nice. Dario F-M is wonderful as always, but he could have done more lecturing in the later stages of the class to keep things more focused.
Pretty disorganized course. Primarily student presentations, I wish Professor Fernandez-Morera would have lectured more because that's when the class was at it's strongest. Oh well, still very little work and the subject matter is interesting if you like history.
