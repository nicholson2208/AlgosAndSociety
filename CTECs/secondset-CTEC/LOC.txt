Comments
This class is good and Mindy is awesome but it is an obscene amount of work!
This class was more work than I expected with long weekly readings and a weekly paper. Sometimes the class periods could get a little long and repetitive, but that is just because it was a 3 hour class. Overall I feel like I learned a lot. Mindy was GREAT and seemed really excited about the material and was super helpful.
Professor Dhoutit is a great professor! She is enthusiastic, patient, engaging, and an effective teacher. She really cares about her students and makes sure that everyone understands the material. I learned so much in this class. The three hours goes by quickly and she often lets students out early. I really enhanced my critical thinking skills and learned how to apply frameworks and theories to analyze and diagnose content from business cases. Truly, one of the most applicable classes I have ever taken.
This class was amazing. Mindy is such an enthusiastic instructor and the material was very interesting.
Great class, learned a ton! a lot of reading that takes time with a weekly 3 page response paper but if you do all the readings the class is very manageable. prof is awesome and always willing to help no matter the hour.
This course is pretty difficult. The TA makes or breaks your grade because he/she grades the weekly assignments. The final group paper and presentation isn't that bad though. Also the class is 3 hours which really drags on. It's hard to stay focused in the class. Only take this course if you have to.
Good class. Professor Douthit is great take it with her!!! The course consists of weekly papers (2-3 pages) that incorporates the theme from the week, a midterm paper (6 pages) and group final paper. Professor Douthit is great and she makes the 3 hours go by pretty fast.
I really enjoyed the writing assignments due each week. Professor Douthit is amazing and I really learned a lot from her teaching methods. I would recommend this course to anyone!
I also feel that the readings mainly adressed topics that are somewhat intuitive. There was also a very very significant amount of reading each week along with a 3-5 page paper and it was hard to not just get frustrated with the amount of material to synthesize weekly. I feel that if there had been less information and less reading I could have spent more time actually working on the writing
Mindy is wonderful! This class is a decent amount of reading and writing, but it's manageable. It took a while to get feedback on some of the work we submitted, but overall this is a really good class.
Great class. Mindy is awesome.
Solid class, really highlights the change aspect of LOC.
Professor Douthit is extraordinary, take this class with her!! This class really got me to see how to apply theory and frameworks to real life cases. I really enjoyed learning how to write in a new way, even though it was very different from the style that I was accustomed to from previous classes. She cultivates riveting discussions and rarely lectures, but when she does lecture, the class is still engaging. For other classes, I have felt like they were sometimes wasting my time, but I have never felt that way about this class and have always looked forward to coming to this one in particular.
very straightforward course and professor douthit presents extremely clear expectations. if you do the readings (about 50 pages a week), you'll do fine on all of the short weekly papers and the final project will come easily.
A LOT OF READING that is required and weekly papers which were kind of hard and were confusing at times. Also class is pretty hard to sit through.

Comments
This class will actually teach you how to implement organizational change! So many real world examples to companies and institutions. You will be able to confidently discuss transitions within organizations by the end.
Douthit is the best! Manageable workload with fun final project
Mindy is such a helpful professor who cares about you learning.
This LOC started out kinda similar to 211 but then it all came together. Prof Douthitt is great and she is really helpful! She has realistic expectations and has interesting lectures!
I liked the structure of this class, but it didn't integrate the frameworks until the very end, which was frustrating. We were asked to integrate the frameworks for our final paper and I wish we had practiced that more in class before being thrown that assignment.
Mindy is amazing and she makes what could be dry material applicable and engaging. It kind of feels like a naturally more in-depth 211
Great course, dry at times, but definitely challenges analytical thinking.
I love Mindy and this course was pretty easy and fairly interesting. Only complaint was some instructions on assignments would be vague and it's not entirely clear how we would use what we're learning in the real-world.
mindy is the mother i've always wanted, the professor i've never had, the woman i strive to be, and the style icon i worship. oh and this class is good too
Mindy is great! This class was very interesting and practical and I felt like the frameworks provided really helpful tools that I'll use in the future.
This class wasn't too challenging and the final project was enjoyable because there were a lot of options on what you could do. Mindy is a great professor and super knowledgable and definitely pushes you to improve your case analysis writing skills which was really helpful
Mindy is the best. She cares so much about her students, to a fault. She goes a little too easy on everyone. I really encourage engaging with the material in-depth and you'll gain a great understanding of frameworks to analyze organizations.
prof mindy teaches you how to use frameworks & models to diagnosis a case study
Prof. Douthit is amazing, super experienced in the field, wants you to succeed, and leads interesting lectures. The course is structured in an efficient and easy to understand way, and assignments aren't too hard if you do the readings beforehand. Highly recommend!

Make sure you show up to class, its part of the grade.
One of those classes where if you just do the readings (~25 pages per week) and put a bit of effort into the responses then you'll absolutely get an A or A-
Way too many writing assignments due at terrible hours. It is very difficult to turn something in at 2pm the day before when I legit have class then... it was annoying af
this was a very easy class, lots of reading but you dont need to do it all, just skim. overall easy class worth taking.
Bethany is so kind and this class is pretty good! you have to take it for SESP, and it's enjoyable. For bethany's class, you read an article or two and have to submit a reading response˽iscussion point the day before each class day. It's not a lot of homework but it's consistent. You learn a lot about how culture plays a role in how we think and learn to question taking information at face value as a universal truth. However, it can get easy to be distracted with a computer or something, so try to pay attention because it is interesting info, it's just not necessary because there are no tests. One final 10 page paper and one small presentation on one of the readings.
A good amount of reading and 2 weekly quizzes on the reading. A good class.
Great class. Dr. Ojalehto is a very sweet and caring teacher. Class was interesting, with both discussion and lecture. The assignments are straightforward and quite simple, they just take a little time. I definitely recommend the class, and taking it with Dr. Ojalehto.
Really cool! very interesting and better than I was expecting.
Course was a lot of reading and engaging in the reading, but this was effective in having me learn the material.
course wasn't hard, just need to do the reading so you can do well on quizzes. and talk in class to get participations points
This was a very interesting class. I had little interest in it beforehand, but it ended up being really insightful!
bethany is so intelligent and will go out of her way to answer any questions or concerns. this course is a great way to challenge the way you think about culture and cognition, and I highly recommend. weekly reading assignments and quizzes but not too much work overall
A lot of reading, you learn to skim but the topics are really interesting. You get out of it what you put into it. Iɽ suggest the class to anyone interested or involved with any form of psychology- this offers a new perspective that I haven't seen in any other class
Honestly not sure what this class was about but overall ok. A little too much work if you're taking it for the diversity distro

Comments
Good class. It makes you think a lot about things that are taken for granted based on our own cultural backgrounds. Very interesting content.
This class is a bit frustrating in the amount of demands put upon doing readings on time in writing reading responses and being quizzed on sometimes nitty-gritty ideas. This class is challenging to keep up with and stay engaged in but if you are able to keep up, the material is very well connected throughout the quarter
Don't know
This class is full of interesting material, but the daily quizzes require you to keep up with the readings
Learned a lot in this course, must put in effort
I was bored most of the time. There was not much content that got me excited about being in the class.
Really enjoyed the class. Thought it brought culture and cognition together in interesting ways, cool readings. The final project wasn't explained super clearly and the responses being due at 2 pm the day before class was difficult because of other classes/work˾tc. Cool concepts but I thought sometimes the readings made broad generalizations between cultures and races that could perhaps be more divisive than educational.
I liked the reading materials and they were very thought-provoking.
I really enjoyed this class and recommend taking it with professor Ojalehto. Weekly assignments and in-class quizzes are not too bad once you get used to them. The final project allows you to pretty much study anything you want which is pretty cool.
This course was graded fairly easily, but it was not particularly interesting as the information all seemed fairly basic. There was (literally) a reading response due the day before every single class, a quiz at the beginning of every class, an attendance grade for every class and a participation grade. This meant that we had all clearly done the readings before every class since we had to write a response paper over them and then take a quiz over them. BUT then the lectures that took the entire class were just the Professor summarizing the readings for us. AND we did not have any midterms or finals except for an independent research paper so there literally was not a reason for us to even learn this information, yet we were not allowed to use laptops in the class so the lectures felt like a pretty big waste of time. I felt like the entire point of the class was simply to get graded on random little things and never once actually facilitated learning. Only take this course to fulfill your SESP requirement if you absolutely have to as it is extremely frustrating.
Interesting and good class, but pretty time consuming. There's a reading response due and an in class quiz consisting of 2-3 questions every class. Both were graded kinda harshly which actually brought down my grade a lot. Honestly, wasn't a huge fan of bethany, but the way she ran the class was stimulating and understandable.
The class wasn't really what I expected. I was kind of frustrated that it seemed like the whole quarter was spent making really huge broad generalizations about various cultures and it felt kind of problematic. The course was really well organized however and easy to follow, and I liked that the final project gave us a chance to explore our own interests, and overall the outside of class assignments were not too hard either.

Comments
Overall, this was a great course. It is basically an introduction to consulting, so if you're interested in that career path, this is a class for you. The textbook was surprisingly interesting, and the papers were *almost* fun to write. However, the fact that class was 3 hours long (in the middle of lunch time) made it hard to focus. Oh, Mindy allows a cheat sheet for the final exam!
I enjoyed this course a lot! I felt that it really helped me begin to think critically analytically about the origins of problems in organizations. The course didn't really focus much on concrete solutions, which is something that I expected it to, but I think that's fine because solutions can vary from case to case. Though we didn't cover that in class, I was not disappointed because there was so much other stuff to learn.
This course was a great intro level course and Mindy is awesome!
I really enjoyed this class. I think Professor Douthit did a good job trying to keep the class engaged despite some of the dry material. I also think that the team dynamic was very strong in this class.
This course was not very challenging because a lot of what we learned was very intuitive. You know that all of this stuff is "true" or you have experienced some of it in practice, and the course just puts names and applies theories to it. A lot of reading but you don't really have to read all of it, you just have to understand the basic concepts and models which aren't hard. Two papers and one exam (where you get to use a big "cheat sheet"). Really easy major requirement for LOC and it is fun to work with a group the whole quarter. Love Douthit!!
Weekly readings, easy reads, a couple papers, and a lot of group work.
I loved that this course emphasized team work and organizations in practice. Professor Douthit was very engaging and made the class fun and practical.
The course itself was pretty easy to follow and the homework was pretty sensible. Three hours is a very long time, and there isn't a ton of diversity in teaching methods, but the breaks help and it's easy information to listen to. The final project is not very challenging if you plan efficiently. Overall it's a pretty decent class.
I learned a lot from the class and it made me realize that I want to continue being an LOC major! Learned a ton, wasn't too difficult but I feel like I absorbed so much information!!
Mindy is an amazing professor. Pretty easy class and interesting too so highly recommend this class even though everyone has to take it at some point.
very good class. you will learn a lot. mindy is the best
Very interesting! Lectures are long but Douthit makes the class go by fast and she always gives us snacks! Lots of reading.
The professor was great. She wanted us to succeed and showed it in every lecture and comment.
Yes, yes, yes! Mindy is an amazing professor. She is prepared for class, she has real-world experience, and there was never a time when I doubted that she knew what she was doing/talking about. She is professional and treats students with respect and does a phenomenal job of facilitating discussion and challenging students to think critically. Even though this a longer class, she makes the class go by fast by using videos, presentations, activities, and group projects to keep everyone engaged. Such a wonderful class and an absolute delight.
Professor Douthit is awesome. Definitely worth taking the course with her, although very introductory, she really gives you content and materials that are real-life applicable. Douthit is also a great professional resource to have and she loves helping her students in any way that she can.
good class, professor mindy is great, reading notes due every week, final presentation, open note exam, and group paper
GREAT CLASS! Professor Douthit is nice and knowledgable and makes class time fun and relevant to what we learn. We play games or do other activities to make the 3 hours go by faster. The actual class is not hard as long as you follow along and do the readings, and the only test is the final and you get a cheat sheet. Would highly recommend even if you aren't an LOC major.
Overall a pretty good class and solid intro to organizations. Was hoping we would study the general concept of organizations but the focus was a little business-heavy rather than also looking at other types of organizations, and the course could be perceived as a crash course to consulting. Mindy is awesome and you still learn a lot about working hands-on in groups and about organizations.
Professor Douthit is amazing. She delivered the material in an interesting way each class and was very clear on her expectations.
I liked the course, but it was difficult at times because I felt like the professor expected everyone to understand the course readings perfectly, when we often did not. The midterm exam was much more challenging than expected and took nearly 3 hours to complete, which no one anticipated. The group project took a lot of work outside of the classroom and the grading was harsher than we expected.
Great class - Douthit is awesome! Highly recommend taking the class if you have any interest in business.

Comments
Great class on LOC, the professor is enthusiastic and has lots of experience in the field, makes for an enjoyable course, and you can learn a lot
great teacher and the course was not too challenging
Great class to take. Weekly reading checks are a pain and are graded a little too strictly, but other than that I enjoyed the class.
This is not a hard class, and you do learn a decent amount if you do the readings. Also, the papers are short and easy.
This was a really easy course! Professor Douthit was great and clearly has a passion for teaching this class. The material, however, was very straightforward, making the class feel as though it were dragging on for 3 hours. There is only a little homework involved, and it is easy to understand.
Love this course and love Mindy. One of my favorite classes so far at Northwestern, 10⼐ would recommend
Professor Douthit is an amazing teacher! Yes, three hours of class first thing in the morning is tough but Mindy keeps it actually engaging by splitting the class into lecture and an activity (we also take a break halfway through). There are only like 3 readings per week that you have to take notes for (to make sure you read them) but they take like no time and are pretty interesting. Other than a few assignments with your group (for the final group project) there is little work throughout the quarter-but it helps if you have a good group. Tbh the final was more dense and longer than I expected but still not too bad at all because Mindy lets you make a cheat sheet for the exam. The final project was actually pretty cool and the work is manageable! Def take with Mindy if you can!!
easy class, interesting to learn about.
Good course. 3 hours go by pretty quick. Group project that isn't too hard.
1) this class is super fun, both in and out of class. I actually WANTED to do the assignments (though that may be a reflection on me being a dorky LOC major than anything)
2) MINDY is so sweet and amazing at conveying the topics she is presenting while keeping her students engaged and interested. Such a good resource and knowledge base on top of that.
3) the group work is OK, it really subjectively depends on who you get placed with. Ultimately it ended up being a positive experience, but it DEF could have gone either way.
I enjoyed the thought and care put into the course from the material to the groups, I think it was very well structured. For a long, 3 hour class, I did not mind it.
This was a solid class overall! A good introduction to what LOC is like. Truly didn't have to put in a ton of time outside of class, just came to class once a week and did a few short readings for homework. There's group work centered around a quarterlong project which is manageable but does mean that you have to find time when everyone is available to meet. Don't be deterred by the 3 hour class: it goes by quickly and we were often let out early. Mindy kept class engaging and did a good job of applying what we were learning to real organizations, which was interesting! I didn't think Org Theory would be something I was interested in, but it's super applicable to everyday life. Solid!! Glad I took it.
gr8 class
This class was pretty good. She is very passionate about the topics. However, it was a three hour long class and the material could have been covered in an hour but it ALWAYS took 3 which is exhausting.
great class, Mindy is a great professor and knows what she is doing, go to class and do everything you need to do and you'll be fine
Mindy was awesome, not too much work there are reading notes every week and like three other assignments. The final portion is with a team so it could get challenging if team doesnt cooperate.

Comments
If you are an LS major, definitely don't take this class to fill the out-of-school learning requirement. It's a reiteration of Methods and LS 301, so you will be bored. A few of the readings are interesting, but it doesn't move fast or hold your attention. Easy enough if it's required, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're really looking for a challenging and rewarding course.
Great class. Take this if you want to design for change. The weekly assignments are time consuming, but not so bad. They are very interesting too. The project is essentially an idea that you and a team come up with and then pitch to visitors and the class. Super cool and fun if you get engaged and have a solid team.
Should not be an LOC requirement. Easy A, but essentially Research Methods Lite. Didn't learn anything new.
this professor was the most monotone and boring teacher i have had at this school. as such, this was the longest 3 hour class i have ever taken in my life. it was nearly impossible to keep an eye open. this class has the potential of being extremely interesting and engaging and super fun but the presentation was so lackluster that it was impossible to get excited about it
This course is really interesting if you're interested in innovation, but if not it can be hard to follow.
The readings were enjoyable and gave us theoretical and methodological tools for conducting field observations and developing design solutions. I also found the field activities engaging. However, during the second half of the quarter the professor would tell us where we should be in the process of working on our group projects the NIGHT before the next class, which was stressful and made it difficult for us to keep each other accountable on the work we needed to be doing consistently throughout our project process. Workload is significant and really depends on how well your group works together, so keep that in mind.
This class just isn't well organized. Prof. Stevens did not really give us an idea of how the course would play out over the quarter, and some weeks we had a ton of work and others we had virtually none. There was not enough time to plan for the final project, and the guidelines were unclear and did not give us a great idea of what the expectations were.
Good class but the three hours would get boring. There is a lot of work especially in the beginning of the quarter with readings and papers and then it shifts more to the group project.
The course was very cool in the sense that we were able to come up with a design as a group to solve a chronic snag, which is a problem that affects many people. Though we were not expected to implement the design, we had to show that it was implementable. It was a very interesting and applicable way of thinking but I felt that the course was spent too much on conceptual theory for the majority of the quarter and then the last three weeks were spent working with the group, which felt very rushed. A good balance would have been conceptual theory for half the quarter and group work for at a minimum the remaining five weeks.

not super difficult but interesting material˿inal project
Peter was a great professor for this class, and made it super applicable to real life and a valuable course to take. Not too much work, tough for 3 hours but good conversation/interesting
Not a very hard class. Reading snapshots every week are actually a decent way of making sure you understand what's going on. Not a ton of work and final is a group project with individual papers.
Overall great course and would recommend. Very relevant and connected reading for every week and most of them are pretty interesting. 3 papers that are fun and interesting to write and a very fun and interesting group project at the end of the quarter. Peter and the TA Alize care a lot about their students and are very passionate about the class which enhances it a lot.
The final project for this class is a lot of work but is actually really fun
Overall, a solid course. Workload is manageable - there's a decent amount of reading and several papers, and a longer final - similar workload to LOC 211 overall, perhaps slightly more. The class itself is interesting, Peter did a great job of keeping the class relevant and providing breaks (3 hour classes are brutal but there's no way around it). I still don't really understand what this class is about, it covered so many topics, but in general it was enjoyable and not too difficult
This class is really great to learn and not very stressful. Lots of discussions which are useful and interesting.
Overall a decent course. Definitely frustrating in the beginning because the name "cognition in contexts" implies something entirely different from what we were actually doing, which fell more along the lines of an intro to design class. Some of the material was fairly interesting, other material was not. Lots of reading and the reading notes could be time-consuming but sometimes it was interesting. A lot of the other students would speak up just to share irrelevant personal stories and hear themselves talk which was kind of annoying, but despite the frustrations you learn a lot in the class through the hands-on work you do.
Good class! Weekly reading assignments can be annoying - but they are helpful for the final paper! Discussions are great!
I actually really enjoyed this class!!! You learn a lot, but it's not hard really. The weekly memos were kind of annoying but that's better than having a midterm. Final project at the end.
This is one of the most informative classes I've taken at Northwestern. The readings are all relevant to the in-class activities and to the final, and despite being a 3 hour lecture, I was able to stay interested and engaged for almost the entire class.
This is a GREAT class! It is a lot about design so be prepared for that. I think it would be more accurately described as "Design for Contexts" but it's a fun course. Lots of work though, for a SESP course, so be prepared for that
Good Course. Laid back and can focus on the material and not worry about your grade 24˷

It could have been shortened into an hour long class rather than 3
Great course, great teacher. Allows you to think outside the box and stimulate your creativity.
Fun class! Not a lot of homework, some weekly reading, a couple of short papers and a final project. discussion/participation based. Lots of in-class activities. Also, Peter is great!
The course was very well constructed
Peter and Aliza are great instructors who care immensely about their students and learning. This class was engaging and interactive, the readings were interesting, and it was overall a very enjoyable course.
Really enjoyable class, a lot of essays at first, but the day to day class is fun due to group activities
There are reading "snapshots" for every reading every week. They take time but are helpful. The readings are normally somewhat interesting. Lectures are well-paced and broken up for a 3 hour class. The papers are easy and the professor and TA give helpful feedback that you can use to help you on the final paper. The final project is a group project. Groups are assigned. If you get stuck in a bad group, the workload towards the end of the quarter can be brutal.
This is probably the best class I've taken at NU, Peter is an amazing professor who makes class fun and interesting. You leave this class having learned a lot that can be applied in school and out of it.
This class can be interesting at times with how we go about with design and redesigning things but at other times it can be boring and repetitive. The readings can get a little boring because it seems that some readings are saying the same thing and the notes are easy but get boring and annoying to do towards the end of the quarter, but they are helpful when writing the final paper. Class in general felt long sometimes, but Peter gave breaks and tried to have it be more hands on than lecture which really helped! Overall, its a good class!
This class was one of my favorites at Northwestern. The three hours felt long but Peter was super engaging and kept the class very interested. The class is not too demanding but the final project will take up a lot of time so prepare for that. Overall awesome course1

Comments
Easy class if you turn in assignments and study for one fairly straightforward mid-term. Sometimes the material felt very elementary and I would leave class not feeling like Iɽ learned anything.
Dorie is dope. Do the readings, come to class and you'll be fine. Final isn't graded by the professor, but by the class
This course is great! Even though 3 hours can get a little long sometimes the topics are very interesting and applicable to future careers and the class usually has an interactive activity to break up the 3 hours
great class
lots of reading. fun activities
As an engineer, this course was amazing! Take it with Doris if you can! DORIS IS THE BEST! If you get in the waitlist don't give up because there is still chance you can get in since they take 10 people from the waitlist.
Loved this class and the concepts covered. take it!
This was a fun class that allowed students to collaborate and exchange ideas, and the course material is very practical. The professor is very helpful and open to students , which allows for a energetic class.
In class midterm is easy and final is take home with 2 weeks to complete. Final projects are open ended which makes any idea a good one. Great class!!
I didn't like how vocabulary was the basis of the course.
I really enjoyed this class. The learning briefs were fun to write about our own experiences and I learned a lot while writing them. The teaching methods in class really engaged the students and the discussions were interesting. The materials covered in this class related well to real life experiences in businesses and life in general.
was good course, learned a lot, i think class could be finished in a starter amount of time but thats not a big issue
This class was great. Course material was really interesting and definitely useful outside the classroom. Even though it was a 3 hour class, we weren't just sitting there the whole time. There are a lot of activities and interaction with classmates that actually help you understand the course content a lot better. Not too much work outside class, you need to do the readings though.

gr8 class
Grading is fair, just nail the midterm and final. Monday night timing is unfortunate, but Prof. Blesoff cares and keeps class moving pretty well! Wouldn't take it if I didn't need to, though.
This class is not super interesting. Professor blesoff is great and really cares about the students. She is clearly intelligent, and proves her knowledge of organizational change on a regular basis.
Interesting class that focuses most on personal and organizational growth. Dorie is very knowledgeable and knows how to teach relevant material. Redundant of u take at the same time as 306
Great class.
I did not get value out of this course. It was repetitive of other LOC courses, and taught nothing new. It was mainly teaching things that were common sense, but drawing them out into a 3 hour course of silly activities to explain a concept that was easily understood. I think if I took this as an underclassman it would have been more valuable and enjoyable, but as a senior taking her last LOC class it lost value.
Despite being useful, the course content is highly repetitive. Class is interactive but it's easy to be minimally engaged; would be much better for the 60 person class to be split into 2-3 sections.
Solid class. You have to take it for LOC anyway, but I'm really glad it was required because I wouldn't have taken it otherwise
This class was required but pretty enjoyable. I definitely learned a lot and the class is broken up well between lecture and group exercises. The final presentation grade is completely based on your peers' grading for you so pick a good group.
I enjoyed the readings from this course and Professor Blesoff is very passionate and knowledgeable. The learning briefs for this class were structured a little differently from the past analytical papers I had to write for other LOC courses. I enjoyed working on the group presentation, which is not graded, but I felt that we spent too much time on it over the course.
This class is required for LOC majors and is overall pretty easy but super unnecessary and not well structured. The books are interesting but the rest of it could be an email.
This a good class, Professor Blessoff is very nice and always has relevant activities in class that help make the 3 hours go by faster. As long as you do the reading the assignments are easy. Grades consist of 3 learning briefs (2 pages), an in class midterm that is open note˻ook˾verything, a final group presentation, and a final take home exam.
she is a great teacher!! made the three hour class not too bad
This course seemed almost more structured like a graduate school course. Lots of openness to share ideas and person thoughts. All contributions and questions are appreciated. The professor is spunky and very knowledgable. She genuinely enjoys teaching, which comes across. The reading and the assignments are not too bad. 3 learning briefs (2 page reflections about the reading), midterm (in class and opgennote), a group project, and a final exam (take home)
The class consisted of three papers, one midterm, a final project, and either a final paper or exam. Professor Blesoff is clearly passionate about what she is teaching us, and I enjoyed having the class once a week for three hours. She kept us engaged by implementing fun exercises throughout the three hours. I never felt as though I was sitting for too long.
Didn’t like this class at all, the conflicting theories being taught were irritating as well as the grading method on the midterm. One of the worse LOC classes.
There are 3 two-page reading reflections, a take home final, and a group presentation. Very low key 3 hour class, you often kind of forget about it until the day it comes around again. The two books, Senge and Wheatley, are actually really good and interesting so it's worth it to take the time to read.

Loved this class because of how hands on it was. Let me learn so much information about the consulting world and gain real life skills. Everything was very applicable. No fluff work! Doesn't take a lot of time outside of class. Very fun and interesting! Professor is soooo nice!
Great course. Very applicable to what I want to do in the future. The small class size allowed for us to really take on the role of a consulting group. Also learned so much about what real team work requires
I really enjoyed this class because it made me reflect on my approach to problem-solving, and how I was bringing my perspective to work with a new client, even though I told myself I wouldn't do that. After this class, I was able to use the same skills I learned from class in another setting and improve my new group's project. I really appreciative of having this class!
This is the most practical LOC class I have ever taken, it will show you whether or not consulting is for you through firsthand experience
Amazing class!! Real world consulting project, weekly reflections, and no individual final/midterm!!
great course. love cecelia!!!! not much work and such a cool class. highly recommend
Great class!!!
