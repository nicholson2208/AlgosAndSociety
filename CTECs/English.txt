Comments
This course is pretty easy going while helping develop writing skills. MUST DO READINGS TO DO WELL. The professor does a good job in helping communicate ideas. Very helpful during individual conferences. Overall, a good class.
Sara was very engaging, personable, and always prepared with material for each class section. She made the course interesting by varying the content but tying it all to common, overarching themes. The feedback she provides is very helpful, and she's always willing to answer questions or provide further reading if you reach out as she is very knowledgeable on the subject.

Comments
The reading assignments were fair and most of the time were somewhat entertaining. Class time was engaging when we discussed the reading.
It is a great class for improving your writing skills as well as reading skills.
I took this course for pretty much no reason at all. I signed up for a sociology class in the same time slot initially, ended up very disenchanted with that class and the instruction, so I dropped it and looked for something that fit in the same time slot, and found this class. So, to be frank, I wasn’t really expecting anything out of it. However, it ended up being a surprisingly good course for me. I’d consider myself a reasonably strong/good writer, generally speaking, but even so this course taught me multiple ways that I could refine and improve my writing, in a variety of contexts. It focuses on multiple styles of writing (research�mia, criticism/review, opinion, etc.) and the instructor is sure to offer you personalized critique and advice for your writing in each style. 


Overall, I was very pleased with the course. The readings aren’t too hard, and yes there are three papers, but they’re very well laid out with clear deadlines and goals, so they’re not all that hard. My vote would be if you’re looking to improve your writing, regardless of context, give this class a try.
I thought this class was helpful if you want to improve your essay writing skills, organization techniques and strategies. I found it hard to catch up with all the reading but when I did, they were very helpful.
Great class, learned a lot to help improve my writing, just go to class and do most of the readings (skimming them is fine)

Comments
This course is a lot of reading but the plays Dr. Phillips picks are enjoyable. Two papers, a midterm and a final. The exams are very fair and she offers extra credit. She expects a lot out of the essays but definitely pushes you to improve your writing.
The TAs and Professor Philips were amazing. AMAZING.
As a senior who never had an interest in Shakespeare, this was the best course I've taken in college. The professor is amazing and builds a personal relationship with every student and brings out all the intricacies of Shakespeare's plays.
This is an amazing course and Professor Phillips is the BEST! We cover a ton of material (it is definitely a lot of reading) but it was super worth it because of how much I learned. Also a good blend of text, films, and productions so you get a really well-rounded exposure to Shakespeare. Lectures were always incredibly engaging and made me think about the plays differently. Professor Phillips really cares about her students, too, which made the experience really enjoyable. Overall a great class, would highly recommend!
I really enjoyed taking this course and reading the course texts. I would basically recommend this class to anyone. On top of all of that the instruction from both the professor and the TAs was really good.
Great for learning how to read a little deeper into Shakespeare, not super difficult, good for distro
A great course to take with a brilliant professor. Prof. Phillips is incredibly adept instructor and is amazingly energetic, bringing up various elements of plays while also using other materials such as movies and contemporary references to guide the course along.
The class is a fair amount of work, as you have 2 papers, a mid-term exam, and final exam, as well as in-class performances and you have to be regular with the reading. The extra-credit work for the pop-culture challenge also adds a time- commitment element to the class, so it adds up.
GREAT COURSE! I love shakespeare, and prof Phillips is a fantastic lecturer. She presents the material in an intteresting, engaging way, and the papers/midterm aren't very tough.
This course was AMAZING. Prof. Phillips was amazing and I can't imagine taking this course without her. Her lectures were always interesting but it was important that you did the reading. Honestly this class is a lot of work and if you don't enjoy the subject or the teaching style of Prof. Phillips, then this class isn't for you. But if you do take it, know that she's amazing and the TAs are there to help you out! There are 2 papers, a midterm and a final.
I had very little interest in taking this course, and ended up taking it because of a scheduling conflict. That said, I am so glad that I ended up in this class because I have learned so much and had a lot of fun. Professor Phillips is a master of making a 100+ person lecture feel like a discussion, and the TAs are brilliant. As someone who only read Shakespeare in high school, I wasn't very enthusiastic about reading Shakespeare, but Professor Phillips changed my whole outlook on the matter. This is a great class for English majors, theatre majors, or anyone who wants to become a better close reader.
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN EASY DISTRO. I took this class having flown through AP and honors English classes in high school with a strong Shakespeare background. This class is by no means an easy A whatsoever or even remotely close. This class is dominated by theatre and journalism majors who really have a burning passion for Shakespeare and the professor and TA pick favorites very quickly. The TA constantly had nonsensical comments on papers (i.e. this paper is too thesis driven) then assigned subpar grades with little explanation. Papers are also fairly long (4-6 pages, 2 total). Pop quizzes are given to ensure attendance but often include extremely difficult and ambiguous questions. Exams include identifying fairly ambiguous quotes and explaining their relevance. If you explain a theme different than the theme intended, you are penalized severely. Professor Phillips is extremely passionate about the subject, but my TA was pretentious and would offer little to no help in office hours. This was the worst and most difficult class I took this quarter, and I also took intensive abstract linear algebra. TERRIBLE CLASS DO NOT TAKE.
This was a great course for developing critical thinking and analyzing text. I learned a lot and Professor Phillips was great. However it was a lot of reading, about a play a week so it will take a lot of time, especially if you want to read the plays closely.
This course is good for people who are very interested in English, however I would not recommend it as a distro because there is a lot of reading and it was at times difficult to keep up with. It was extremely helpful to learn about close reading and analyzing text, especially considering our essays were normally focused on a very small part of a particular play.
I enjoyed the plays we read, the movies we watched, and Professor Phillip's analysis on the plays. The discussions we had in lecture were interesting, but sometimes relied too much on student participation when I wish I got to hear more from Professor Phillips.
This course was a pretty good one. It was interesting and Professor Phillips is very engaging and exciting. It was just A LOT to handle, as we had to read 7 of Shakespeare's plays over the whole quarter--which is a lot, especially in the tiny-font Norton book. The plays were fun to read, though, and it was interesting to hear others' perspectives. I just think it might be better if we could read even one less play, to have more time to understand it and go a lot more in-depth.
This was a truly unbelievable class. Professor Phillips is one of the most amazing lecturers I have ever had, and I could not recommend this class more highly. However, this is certainly not an easy and light work 200 level English class, so be prepared to work hard! If you like Shakespeare at all, you will LOVE this class.
Professor Phillips is an absolutely incredible professor and this class was phenomenal. Very few professors make the effort to get to know their students like she does, and the class, despite being tremendously quickly paced, was an absolutely amazing time and helped me learn a ton about Shakespeare and his works. I feel like I know significantly more coming out of this class than I did going in, and I'm very tremendously happy that I took it and would recommend it to any student who is even remotely interested in Shakespeare. Again, this class moves tremendously quickly, and I would not take it with an already busy schedule, but I took it as a distribution requirement and it was by far my favorite course of the quarter.
This class was a lot of work (obviously because we basically read a play a week) but in ways that I wasn't expecting too. There's a graded scene performance and the midterm˿inal are ridiculous in the amount of writing they expect you to do in an hour and a half (and then they're graded harshly with no explanation as to what you did wrong). It's all way too much for a 200-level distro, and even though I liked the professor and my TA, it wasn't worth it. Don't take it unless you're a theater major who writes well and talks all the time; these people were like half the class and completely dominated lecture and discussion, so I assume they're doing well in the class.
It was really fun. We got to act out scenes from different plays, and form arguments from the text. It was a great intellectually stimulating class.
Very engaging and interesting way of teaching Shakespeare
This class was great but not easy. It is certainly not an easy A, there are 2 essays, a midterm, and a final, and each of them are graded very harshly - maybe too harshly for an introductory course. That being said, Professor Phillips is a great teacher and really makes Shakespeare very interesting to discuss. She is adept at teaching a large group of student yet making it feel like a smaller discussion-based class. Nina was a great TA and super helpful - I would take this class if you are at all interested in Shakespeare or english classes.
This is a fantastic course. Professor Phillips is an incredibly engaging, incisive, funny lecturer who gets right to the heart of each of the plays. She has very high standards and I felt pushed to put out my best work all quarter, but the classroom had a very inspiring, non-oppressive feel to it. I felt like I really grew as a reader of Shakespeare and an analytical writer this quarter. Also, I had already read four of the seven plays in high school, but Phillips examines them much more rigorously than my high school teachers ever did, so I was by no means bored. I highly, highly recommend!
It was a lot of work, but forcing yourself to read all the plays and deeply analyze what is being said is a very important skill and I definitely improved in that regard.
Heavy reading. Read one play a week, for the most part. Two papers and a midterm and final. There were about three pop quizzes in lecture. Overall, highly recommend the course. Was my most interesting and engaging course of the quarter. Dont think there could be a professor more thoughtful, detailed, and caring than Professor Phillips that could teach this course. Definitely not an easy course, but completely worth the time and effort.
I would recommend this course to anyone. Professor Phillips in such an intelligent, informed professor who makes lectures incredibly engaging. Because we read and discussed so much Shakespeare in the quarter, I quickly became so much more comfortable with the material so each consecutive play became easier to understand and analyze. This class is a lot of reading, however. We had to read a full Shakepeare play almost every week so even though I absolutely loved the class, you have to be prepared for that much Shakespeare reading every week.
This course was excellent! Professor Phillips is a passionate and inspired teacher, and there was always something new and exciting to talk about in lecture. The TAs were fantastic, and I really got a lot out of discussion sections.
As someone who loathes Shakespeare, I found myself pleasantly surprised at this course. I was dreading it, especially after getting a C in high school Shakespeare, but this course totally changed how I look at Shakespeare. Readings can be tedious and the midterm˾xam is difficult, but you can easily prepare for it by taking good notes during lecture and re-reading the plays before exams.
Iɽ say it's a good freshman "intro to college class," but I didn't find it very valuable as an upperclassman. The exams are about regurgitating the themes that the professor presents in class rather than presenting your own analyses, and there is a lot of memorization required that I do not find valuable. Was excited to take this course because I love Shakespeare, but I was left disillusioned.
The reading is manageable but the course content is very difficult and the workload is high. The pop quizzes aren't too bad, but the essays are fairly involved (6ish pages of close analysis), and there is a section performance that is a very very difficult assignment if you're not used to memorizing and performing plays (I had to memorize about 50 lines). The midterm exam is difficult but manageable if you just read the plays, and they can't be easily bypassed by reading summaries. In addition to the pop quizzes, midterm, and first essay, there is both a final essay and a final exam, which really feels like way too much work for a distro. A lot of students in the class were theater kids and really seemed to enjoy it, but it's not that way if you have very little interest in Shakespeare. I had trouble keeping up with the lectures, but that's really mostly because I was uninterested in the subject. But I think Suzy is a good lecturer, and she has enthusiasm for the subject, so I can see why students who like the subject would enjoy the lectures. To recap, this class has three pop quizzes, two essays, two exams, and a performance. None of these assignments is easy. I would not recommend this class unless you have a strong interest in theater or Shakespeare, and I would not recommend it to people in STEM who are doing this for the distro. There are much easier distros out there. One final thing: the class is very geared toward freshmen, and the vast majority of students are freshmen.
This course is extremely well taught. Both the professor and the TAs are unbelievably passionate and knowledgeable. Every class is a combination of lecture, discussion, close reading, performances, film viewings, trivia and more, which always keeps it exciting. Expectations are high, but the material and its presentation are exemplary.
Definitely more time consuming than some other English classes. Professor Phillips is a great professor though and if you keep up with the reading (unlike me) you'll be fine
I absolutely loved this class, it was a lot of work, but none of it was busywork, Phillips and the TAs really want to make sure you learn as much as you can and are very passionate about the topics.
Kinda annoying course, although professor genuinely cares.
Professor Phillips is incredibly knowledgeable and so engaging. She is possibly one of the best professors I've had here so far. Shakespeare really scared me at the beginning of this quarter and her class made the material feel so much more accessible and exciting to discuss. She truly teaches the class in a way that shows how much she cares about students learning and your grade will truly affect the work you've put in. It's by no means easy, but if you show up to lecture and read the plays, you will gain so much from this course and feel challenged as well as supported!!
Professor Phillips is the nicest human being. Taking a class with her is a must.
We covered plays in different mediums, through live performance, reading, and media, which I think is important for grasping how the Bard's work can be interpreted. Overall the course is great, covering so much in so short a time that it's impossible to feel like you haven't learned anything.
The course was interesting, but the requirements of watching a movie and reading a play every week take more time than expected.
This course is really interesting, but requires a lot of out of class time because of all the reading. You read one play per week, and because of the nature of the exams, you really have to read the real plays.
Not an intro course. Extensive reading every single week and pop quizzes. TA also was extremely unhelpful. Exams were a poor measure of what we learned
This is a really worthwhile class. Phillips has a passion for Shakespeare, and it comes through in her fascinating and thought-provoking lectures. Grading isn't incredibly easy, but Phillips and her TAs clearly want students to succeed. The course isn't a huge time investment, and it's fairly easy to do well if one reads the plays by the time one is supposed to. Definitely a great class to take for prospective majors or otherwise.
It was an interesting class to fill a distro without being burdensome
Professor Phillips is one of the most brilliant teachers I have ever encountered. The way she engages with her students on not only an intellectual but a personal level is incredible. She knew every one of the 100ish students' names by the end of the first week. She took the passion I already harbored for Shakespeare and his works and amplified it by introducing whole new ways of thinking about texts I may already have read. I cannot stress enough that everyone even remotely interested in Shakespeare should undoubtedly and immediately try to fit it into their schedule next fall. One of a kind.
The class was fine. Although, if I could go back, I would not take it. I did not like the lecturing style of Prof. Phillips. It constantly felt as if we were in a high school lecture. It was a huge lecture, yet most of class was spent as if it were a discussion. It became hard to follow, and tiresome.
Everything Susie Phillips says is enlightening.
I loved this class. I improved my argumentative writing and close reading skills. In addition, I got to learn a lot about Shakespeare's works in a very engaging setting! You get the grades you deserve in this class. You get out of this class what you put into it. Solid class overall.
I thought the course was overall interesting and enjoyable. You have to read a lot of plays, but the pacing of the course made it bearable, and there were opportunities to catch up. Overall the papers were interesting and the tests fair.
It is jam packed with theatre majors, so the curve is not that good. As a comms major, it was sometimes overwhelming because the theatre kids always try to be above and beyond during lecture, so be prepared for that. You only write 2 major papers, which is not bad at all as long as you do the readings. The mid terms and finals are hard in that you really have to close read each of the texts and actually watch the movies on your own time.
As a junior, it can be easy to feel jaded in big lectures, but this was honestly one of my favorite courses I have taken at NU. I really have a new appreciation for Shakespeare's plays, and Phillips is so so smart, caring and an overall awesome professor! Take this class!
This course pushed my analysis and required that I become a more focused writer. Much of the readings were readings of Shakespeare's Plays with little extraneous material, which made the outside reading requirement relatively low. Both Professor Phillips and my TA were extremely helpful and presented interesting interpretations of the plays.
I loved the plays and enjoyed listening to her analysis, but the exams and papers were incredibly difficult and we were not prepared for them. The midterms had no review material or study guides, yet had incredibly specific rubrics and were largely based on memorization or details not emphasized in class.
Professor Philips is SO FANTASTIC! This was by far the best class I took this quarter, and probably one of the best I'll ever take. Her lectures encouraged me to think about the plays and to participate in class (she remembered everyone's names after week 2), and hugely added to my reading and interpretation of the plays. When you learn Shakespeare, you learn about all of literature, and as the weeks went by, I really came to a much deeper understanding of the themes and writing of his plays. Professor Phillips is incredibly charismatic, and manages to inspire students by making the themes of 400 year old plays freshly original and relevant to our time. This is definitely a hard class, with tons of reading and writing (especially in exams), but I was very motivated by the lectures to improve over the course. Don't take this if you're swamped with all of your other classes (do it right) of if you're not interested in Shakespeare and the process of reading and analyzing it, but this is an absolutely amazing lecture and is very rewarding. SO GOOD!
At the beginning of the course, I was definitely bogged down by the reading. I was trying to understand every little thing about every play, which slowed me down significantly. But, once I got a feel for what the professor was looking for, I began to enjoy the course a lot more. Professor Phillips's theses in class caught me as very surprising and were fun to follow along or argue against. And although I felt a bit too nervous to speak up in lecture, discussion sections eased that tension quite a bit. My least favorite part was probably the movies; I fell asleep most of the time and my interest in Shakespeare waned because of them.
This class helped develop my love and passion for reading, writing about, and above all, studying Shakespeare.
This course was incredibly well-constructed and informative. Professor Phillips challenged us intellectually, while making sure that her lessons were clear and understandable. It is a large class, but she made the class environment feel small/intimate as she constantly was encouraging students to participate/speak up and contribute to her lectures. She also remembers everyone's names, which just goes to show her amazing attention to detail, and the genuine care she has for her students. She is incredibly fair regarding the difficulty of tests/homework, and grading. Incredibly fair.
I had a great time. Even though it was an early class it was fun to be in as Professor Phillips lectures were always engaging. She lead the class in examining the text in new ways so that even if you had read them before, you saw a new perspective. I wish there were more graded opportunities because there were only two papers to demonstrate your growth. The reading seems like a lot at first but as the course continues you tend to get faster, and your reading more close just based on the example set by the lectures. The mid term and exam were both fair assessments of course knowledge.
The professor was fantastic! Her takes on Shakespeare and her ability to deliver it clearly and entertainingly in lecture made this class amazing. The TAs were also particularly good (a/o to Harris) and helped a lot.
This is the BEST class at Northwestern, Susan Phillips is a magical woman and truly changed/grew me as a learner and shakespeare-lover. This class completely cracked open Shakespeare and made it accessible to me, which I really appreciated especially as a theater major. The discussions and lectures were crazy compelling and interesting. By about the third class Susan Phillips knew every students name in the lecture... which was about 100 kids. It was remarkable to feel how invested she was in the class and in the students and in the material. It was fun, and interesting, and fair. (Tests were hard but if you showed up and read the material they were very fair). Good stuff!
I absolutely loved this course, and have never learned more about Shakespeare or his work than I did this quarter. The professor is phenomenal, and her TA's were all top-notch. For some, reading Shakespeare might be a chore, but in this class you learn to read it much like its own language and it is so much fun. Highly recommended.
This class and its CTECs LIE. No one told me before taking this class how much I would regret taking it in the first place. If you are not a theater major avoid at all costs. She speaks to the class like they are freshmen in high school, and grades like they're English majors. You have to study 7 plays and get tested on random passages with no context. You write an in-class essay for the final after you already turned in a final paper. There were several classes where I left frustrated knowing I didn't have to be there at all. Take if you love raising your hand and talking for 5 minutes about Othello in front of a 150 person lecture!

Comments
This course is incredible. Everyone should take it. Professor Phillips is brilliant and brings the course material to life.
This is very much a class geared towards freshmen, so it was somewhat awkward taking this class as a senior for a distribution. Professor Phillips is a good lecturer, and the course looked at several works from new angles that I had not anticipated. The pacing of the course is fairly quick, and there are (unfortunately) pop quizzes, so it's important to stay on top of the readings. That said, the time requirements are not too bad, so it's a good course for a distribution requirement.
This is definitely not an easy class and I am not expecting excellent grades but I still think taking this class was a right thing to do! Professor Phillips is truly the best professor ever both academic-wise and personality-wise!
I loved this class; Professor Phillips is wonderful and each lecture was more interesting than the last. There is quite a bit of reading and the exams are challenging, as they involve a great deal of writing within a small timeframe.
The professor is incredibly engaging and the course is great all around. Also great TAs
I'm a math major and I enjoyed this course a lot. It was a distro for me, and I've had some Shakespeare experience, but that doesn't mean it was extremely easy. I was still challenged at times but it was worth it. Prof Philips is a great, great teacher; she gave so much info about the plays that helped for quizzes and papers and the midterm. She also kept it lively, not just boring lecture. There were a few reading quizzes (pretty simple), a midterm which was short answers, two papers not too long, and a final which was short answer and an essay question. Overall, the material was doable. I found sections to be good too. If you have any interest, consider taking it with Philips for sure!
This is an amazing course. Intro to Shakes will make you a better reader, writer, and person, and the professor, Susie Phillips, is amazing.
I loved this class! Prof. Susie Phillips is a dream. She preps like a whole essay worth of material for each class and hits that perfect balance between lecture and discussion (especially for a class this big)! It is a totally manageable amount of work and the number of plays we had to read was honestly way better than I thought it would be. There were a crazy amount of theater kids but I totally still knew people in the class! Def take this class
It's difficult, especially with the reading and trying to keep one play straight from the other because some of the questions are applicable with a lot of plays which makes her quizzes and exams challenging. But it's a good challenge and pushed me to study and develop better habits as a student. DON'T TAKE IT if you don't pay attention to detail or like diving deep into texts and their historical significance. This is not the course for you
Prof. Phillips is probably the best professor I had at Northwestern. She for sure made me a better writer, thinker, and she takes time to get to know all her students, even in a large class. Lots of work for the class, as there are papers, tests, and section, but it is worth it. Also, Matt Beeber is an amazing TA.
The pace was a bit rough, and I was never 100% certain what acts and scenes she wanted us to read by what class--it averaged out to a play a week. Stay on top of the reading because there is a lot! She does give pop quizzes, but they're relatively straight forward (though sometimes if you weren't sure if you were supposed to read the whole play or just the first 3 acts, you could lose points on a quiz when it tested over the whole thing). A lot of information is thrown at you, but it is super interesting. The professor is engaging and understanding-very easy to talk to. There's not much time for the midterm or final, so write fast. Overall a great class that really digs into the text and makes you think.
This class was awesome! There was a lot of reading. 2 exams and 2 papers mainly. If you are bad at keeping up on reading this may not be the best.
Professor Phillips is incredibly passionate. It can be difficult to keep up at times, but the challenge pays off.
Prof. Phillips is one of the greatest people I have ever met. Even if you don't like Shakespeare, take this class to get to know her and learn about life.
Take this class with Susie Phillips! She is a fantastic professor and very knowledgeable about everything. This class will challenge you to closely analyze Shakespeare's texts, you will be pushed in that aspect, but a very fun and helpful English distro. ALSO TA Matt Beeber is the best, take any class that he is TAing.
This class is a lot of reading, but it's never boring. Susie Phillips is WONDERFUL. Her lectures were so engaging, and she made an effort to connect with every student, despite the large class size. Take this class!
Class was always super interesting. Professor Philips is amazing and brought so much energy to class every morning. You can tell she really cares about her students and class content. She also brings candy to class all the time.
Take this class even if you have the slightest interest in Shakespeare! Professor Phillips is genuinely a captivating and interesting lecturer and all the TA's are wonderful. It is fast paced though, so make sure to keep up with the play readings. 10⼐ recommend, as this is the best class I've taken at Northwestern so far. I met close friends due to how interactive the class is, and the discussion sections were stimulating but also really enjoyable. Prof. Phillips also knew all our names by the 3rd class!
I really liked the teacher's ability to address the student's thoughts but also to challenge us to point to the text and to think of the why.
Professor Phillips is AMAZING. She might be the best professor I've had at Northwestern so far. The lectures are all extremely engaging, the readings are obviously interesting given that they're all Shakespeare plays and the TAs were all great. I would 100% recommend this course to anyone.
I love this course. It is certainly not easy, but Professor Phillips made me look forward to coming to class everyday which is the most important part of teaching.
Take this course for SUZIE. She is unbelievable and I've learned so much from her.
Really, really interesting class. Professor Phillips is engaging, caring, and easily the smartest woman I've ever met. She makes an effort, even though it's a large class, to get to know a majority of her students. I would take any class she taught. 11⼐ recommend.
As a theater minor, I wanted to learn more about literature and how it relates to performance, which this course actually does a lot of, but not too much (so if you are not into performing, that doesn't matter, it's still a great course). I learned more about how to analyze texts, and even more about what Shakespeare was trying to say with his writing, and even things that he may have no intended, but now in modern times we recognize and interpret. It gave me a whole new perspective on Shakespeare's work.
My main reason for taking this class was that I wanted to read more Shakespeare, and I definitely did that! We read 7 plays throughout the year that I really enjoyed and and had really interesting classroom discussions about all of them. However, I thought the midterm and final were WAY to long, for even though I knew all of the information, I still couldn't finish in time. Still a good class to take!
This course was a lot of work, but was also an enjoyable class. Lots of different components - papers, tests, performances, discussion, readings - but if you went to class and read the plays you could do fine. Great professor and TAs.
Great class, definitely more work than your average 200 distro, but definitely worth it. Phillips is a very engaging lecturer, and you definitely come out of this class with more appreciation for the material.
One of the most important aspects of this class that I noticed is how important it is to Professor Phillips that everyone does well on papers and the mid-term. She truly does care about each and every one of her students and reaches out to anyone who is in need of help. The lecture sometimes was a little tedious to get through since you just go through quotes about the play you are reading, but the arguments that are made by Professor Phillips in these lectures do elucidate a key characteristic of the play. The papers are oddly enjoyable. The quizzes suck, but they are not that important in the final grade so that makes up for it. The discussion sections were awesome. My TA was fun and really got us to think about the play in a different way than i had ever thought about Shakespearean plays. Cameron helped us out with anything that we needed and he read my thesis on my final paper to see if i had a strong argument, which really helped me a lot. In short, this class was spectacular because of the importance that the professor and Teacher's Assistant gives to every student, even though the material was not that exciting.
Awesome class. Professor Phillips is DOPE and so is Delali. It's a LOT of reading, but it's worth it in my opinion.
Professor Phillips is awesome. She's a fantastic lecturer and if you're interested in English, you need to take a class with her before you leave. The readings can be long but it isn't too brutal, and it's easy to play to catch up if you have to. Definitely take this class if you want a cool English elective.
This course is fantastic if you want a nice introduction to Shakespeare with a fantastic teacher and great TAs. No previous knowledge is required, and a lot will be gained throughout the course. Grading is fair, and homework is fairly light, though there is a good amount of reading required. The midterm was very fair, and the class really helps you practice your critical thinking skills. Not to mention Susie Phillips is just a fantastic, intelligent, and very emotionally invested teacher who really just wants you to learn and become a better person. A great use of your quarter.
I am so happy to have taken this class because I think it really challenged my analytical skills. Since I am a freshman, I am now interested in possibly pursuing an English major because of Intro to Shakespeare.
Professor Philips has a great way of making something that could be dry in the hands of another professor vastly intriguing. The class is very fair: if you read the plays, you will do well. The papers, while challenging, were never a burden. My biggest complaint would be the time constraint the midterm and final exams put you under: there simply was not enough time for majority of the class to finish their midterms.
I was a fan of the in-class discussions and thought they were an insightful companion to the texts. However, as I am not a skilled writer, I found the writing sections very stressful.
A great range of Shakespeare's plays in one quarter and Prof. Phillips is an amazing lecturer. However, between the readings, watching the film versions, 2 papers, and exams, I found that the course took much more of my time than I expected.

I learned a lot about John Milton from someone who is passionate about his writings and has devoted her career to her.
Prof. Schwartz is extremely knowledgable about Paradise Lost and all of Milton's writings. Most of the class consisted of her going over all the readings, which was really helpful because Paradise Lost is incredibly dense. Overall workload wasn't too bad either, 3-page midterm paper, 8-10 final paper and a presentation during the quarter. The whole class had a very laid back feel, which wasn't what I expected going into a class about John Milton.
1 midterm paper (3 pages), 1 final paper (8-10pg), 1 oral report. Not too much work, which left a lot of time to focus on the text.
What you takeaway from the course is proportional to the effort you put in. Schwartz is an expert in Milton and really helps to unpack the density of Paradise Lost. Whereas I derived a lot of value from the theological explanations of MIlton's perspective, I can't say I improved a ton as a student.
If you are in any way interested in reading Paradise Lost, take this class with Prof. Schwartz. She is insanely knowledgeable of Milton and his works, and also quite nice, and as a result, I found this class to be very rewarding.
Reading paradise lost and understanding it and it's significance.
Prof. Schwartz clearly knows a ton about Milton and has endless insights into Paradise Lost. I was a little annoyed at how often class got derailed by tangential discussions that had little to do with the text. I wish I heard more from Schwartz in class.
Prof. Schwartz is super knowledgable about Milton, and she does a great job of helping you understand it. Not very many assignments other than the reading.
Prof. Schwartz is very knowledgeable about Milton, but I found the class to be a bit dull. The reading schedule was uneven, starting with one book a week, but by midterm season, we had two books of Paradise Lost per week and were getting behind. Ultimately, we had some great theological discussions, but I think Schwartz is a little too close to the material for apt criticism of the work.
Not too much work but very interesting class. I had no idea who Milton was prior to taking this class and he’s actually a super cool dude. Paradise lost was a very dense read, but the professor was super good at explaining what was important to the understanding of the book.
While paradise lost is an amazing book, I did not feel that the instructor taught it in an effective way that made her students want to learn. whenever we expressed our opinions she told us they were wrong if they were not what she believed to be Milton's interpretation, and left no room for opinion.
Great class if you're interested in John Milton or Renaissance literature, everything is well explained and the assignments are straightforward and not too difficult or too easy
Great course, highly recommend. Grading system was fair with 2 papers and a presentation.
A really wonderful class for discussing religion and the ideas presented in the Bible, but not so great if you're looking to engage with Milton's words on a literary level. A lot of the class is just listening to the professor translate that week's reading to you and then some really engaging discussion about the ideas presented in Christian ideology. Not a bad class, but definitely not what I expected.
This was a good course, Paradise Lost was super interesting and the prof was really good at making us understand what was going on. She really knew the book and Milton. I wish it was a little more participation based as a lot of classes are just her talking about the chapters we had to read, which wasn't really that bad since it really helped me understand the book.
Prof. Schwartz is very enthusiastic about teaching this class, but it didn't go as in-depth into literary analysis as I was hoping.

Comments
Professor Schwartz held great discussions that really allowed us to explore the text according to our own interpretations. She is so knowledgeable about the text that she was able to really help us advance our own understandings. The supplementary texts are intriguing and very helpful.
Take this class. It is easy, with a very light workload. 20-30 pages of reading a week, one 3 page midterm paper, and one 10 page final paper. Half the time I left class, I didn't have homework. Plus, Prof Schwartz is very passionate about Milton. Even if you have no understanding of the Bible or Genesis, she makes the work approachable. If you need a 300 level pre-1830 English class, take this one. It's pretty painless.
I loved taking this class. Professor Schwartz has so much expertise; she really teaches you how to appreciate Milton. She helps you understand difficult passages and love them even more. There were so many moments when I read something and was just in awe of how Milton could write so perfectly. My only complaint is that you don't get letter grades on your assignments, so you won't know how you're performing until final grades come out.
Professor Schwartz is simply one of the best (and kindest) humanities professors Northwestern has. Taking Milton with her was an invaluable experience!
I really enjoyed this course. Not too much work, fun discussions.

Comments
This class was my favorite class this quarter! I always looked forward to coming to discussions and sharing my thoughts about the readings. My favorite part was of course the writing itself, though. Professor Donohue is so inspirational and she really lets you use your creativity and write your ideas in whatever way youɽ like while still assigning structured writing and restrictions for each assignment. Professor Donohue is a great mentor––she is so sweet and always open to answering questions or even just to talk, and her comments and feedback on my writing were extensive and very helpful in focusing my future drafts and revisions. Also, the final short story workshopping experience was really special and a wonderful experience––I loved reading everyone's story and, surprisingly, having my own story workshopped. It was really cool to hear what others thought about your writing while also offering your own opinions and comments about other people's writing. The workshopping experience really helped me focus my editing not only on grammar and flow, but also on the structure of the writing and how the writer could better illustrate something in their writing. The course also wasn't extremely time consuming, with 2 poem assignments, one personal narrative, and one short story assignment (and then a final revision of one of your previous writing assignments). Overall, I highly recommend this dynamic and engaging course to anyone who is interested in creative writing, or even if you just really enjoy writing poetry, creative non-fiction, and/or fiction.
The class taught me some of the basics of writing. The frequent workshops provided a lot of support for my writing.
Sheila is a great professor, but I think the quality of this class really depends on the other students in the class. There were 15-16 students in this class, and most of them were pretty chill, but we did have some "harkness warriors" which are people who like to dominate the conversation. The plus side of having a small class is that you get very comfortable with everyone. I also really like that we got to workshop our poems and essays. I feel like workshopping⾾ing workshopped improved my skills as a writer.
The class was a great balance of reading & writing. I really enjoyed it.
If you are at all interested in creative writing, I highly recommend this course. Sheila Donohue is incredibly engaging and insightful. She's excellent both at leading discussions and at providing helpful, insightful criticism. The class is structured so that with each genre, we first read and discuss published work, then write our own pieces. I found this a very helpful way to learn how to write each genre because it drew my attention to the kinds of artistic decisions I could make when writing. Easily one of my favorite classes thus far!
Amazing class - a great easing in to creative writing for those who are out of practice or those who haven't done so much creative writing in the past. The assignments are interesting and the texts read in class are useful, but the best part of the class is definitely working with a community of writers and your teacher to produce and edit pieces.
This class was awesome, covered enough different kinds of writing to have a variety but also few enough that we went in depth in each one. Was a great experience.
Very good course to take as an elective.
This is a super awesome class and the best academic decision I made freshman fall quarter. Its small environment and ample chances to write poetry, creative essays, and short stories are something really unique for a freshman class, where most other writing based classes will ask you to write analytical essays. The chance to explore all three genres of writing was really awesome as I never really got the chance to do so during high school. Donohue is an awesome professor who is great at getting the class to bond together and improve each others' writing. I had so much fun in this class and it made me start thinking about minoring in creative writing down the road. If you can get in - you need an early registration time because it does fill fast - don't hesitate and take this class.
So much fun!! The class really bonded and Sheila was amazing at guiding conversation and leading us towards accurate analysis.
I learned about the genres and workings of creative writing, my own strengths and weaknesses as a writer, and myself. I'm a big fan.

Comments
Good class but I was a complete beginner and did struggle a little
While I really enjoyed the reading and writing assignments for the class, the dynamic of class discussions was very unbalanced, where one student would talk most of the time, and so I feel as though I didn't get much out of the opportunity to learn from other people. It was really frustrating.
Not what I expected, but the final submission showed me that I grew as a writer. It began boring but gradually got much better. Worth taking.
Definitely take this class if you're interested in creative writing and already have experience writing it. However, the course is more focused on discussion of literary techniques based off of literary texts to give a taste of poetry, prose fiction, and creative nonfiction. There is writing and some workshopping, but the class does not hold your hand and teach you the techniques of writing. You just write. In a way, the class is preparing you for the rigor and mindset of future creative writing classes and getting you into the act of writing, point blank. It's not about being a good writer in this course; it's about improving in writing compared to the beginning and the end of the course. However, if you have had no experience prior to creative writing, you may feel like you're hitting the ground running since despite being an "intro" class, the course expects you to write poems, short stories, and a creative nonfiction essay after reading and discussing only a few examples and then to be, at the stage of draft #1, ready to share and workshop with others.
This course is an excellent introduction into creative writing and is both fun and thought provoking. If you have a chance to take this class, take it!
I wish that the course could have explored writing more poetry and maybe writing more short passages instead of reading as much.
I found the readings enjoyable and class discussions of them valuable, and the experience of sharing my writing with Professor Curdy and the other students during group critiques provided me with a valuable space to improve. All in all, I'm sure that this was the best English course I could have taken in my first quarter at Northwestern.
The most relevant reaction of mine to this course is that my writing didn't feel rewarded at all.
The pieces we read were so great and good examples to go off of for our own writing. Professor Curdy is very helpful and available to meet with you out of class to talk about how to improve your writing. Great course!!!!!!!
I enjoyed the pieces and how the class worked together to analyze the texts. It was not very encouraging to those who were not as experienced or confident as others.
My main goal going into this course was to improve my revision skills as well as to refine my writing skills overall. This course did both of those things for me and more. It really helped me to figure out that my interest in creative writing went deeper than I thought. Professor Curdy's criticism is only ever constructive and she shares so much with her students.

Comments
It's a great class for you to look critically at your own work and have the time and space to improve you writing. You also learn how to analyze work as well.
I had not really done any creative writing in high school, so this class was definitely a challenge, but definitely my favorite class so far at NU. The class gets very close because of the subject matter, Prof. Donohue is fantastic, and the structure of the class allows us to really give thought to our piece in all of its stages.
Professor Donohue starts out the course by going over different aspects of genre and writing in general which provides a framework for how we understand the rest of the readings and discussions for the quarter. She is incredibly insightful and has a vast knowledge of literature and poetry. Whenever I would be excited about a piece we read in class, she was always willing to give me suggestions of other readings and just chat. I loved this class and it seemed like pretty much everyone else did too!
This course would be great if you already have experience in creative writing, but if you've never done it before and are looking to learn how, it's not the best. It is really fun to read everyone's work though and the workshops are very helpful.
That nebulous space between prose and poetry is a space Iɽ never explored before, so that alone made the class valuable to me. It also exposed me to the varied work of authors who wouldn't have otherwise been on my radar. The course reader for this class is something I'll probably actually hold onto for years! The course sharpened my writing and critiquing skills. Not only did I learn from the work of experienced professionals, but I learned from the work of my peers. The classroom was an extremely supportive space, and I was very fortunate to create in such a space. The daily warmups were also very helpful for just greasing the creative gears, and I love the cartoonist's "grid" exercise which Professor Donohue showed us. (I'm forgetting the name of both the cartoonist and the exercise.)
This course was a great way to write and get feedback from your peers. The stories assigned were interesting. It took some time to gain momentum.
Hands down the best professor I've had this quarter. I love the workshops, I love the readings, and most of all, I love SPD - she's equal parts no-nonsense and a complete sweetheart. Criticism is brutal, but in a really good way; she knows exactly what's wrong with your piece and how to improve it, although the latter she leaves up to you - after all, that's part of the challenge of writing.
Easily my favorite course that I took all quarter. The subject material is outstanding, class is always stimulating, and Professor Donohue is truly a passionate professor who cares about her students and their learning. Take this class!!
We read some amazing pieces, but I was hoping to develop more of a writing habit than I was able to. There was very little writing expected and we spent a lot more time on poetry than I thought we were going to. For that reason, I thought the creative nonfiction and especially the fiction units were cut short.
I loved this course, and it actually encouraged me to switch out of Medill and pursue the creative writing program. I cannot stress enough how fulfilling this course is.
LOVED this class. Professor Donohue is incredibly receptive and encouraging. We read lots of interesting pieces (fiction, poetry, nonfiction) which really helped me as a writer. Also, workshopping your piece with the whole class, while daunting, is a very valuable experience
If you like creative writing, or think you might, TAKE THIS! I had no real prior experience in creative writing

Comments
I loved how in-depth the analysis of literature was in helping us understand America in the 20th century. If I had read the books myself, I would never have been able to understand so many things or "see" what these sentences actually mean or what the characters feel. The best thing about the course is that all the four books are a delight to read and they are connected in an extricable manner so you will find yourself going "oooh" and "aaah" at the end of it. The writings and papers were not overwhelming so it's a great class to take.
It was a good class for a distribution. The texts are very interesting, Professor Cutler is very energetic and makes lectures fun, and the workload is manageable.
Very little work outside of class, other than reading and two very short essays (one was 3-4 pages, one was 4-5, and they were just text analysis). Professor Cutler is very easy to listen to; his lectures are amusing and the information he focuses on is interesting and adds to your experience of the text.
Amazing class, the books we read were incredible and the discussions were enlightening and engaging.
Prof. Cutler is extremely engaging, clearly invested and passionate about the topic, keen to explain the historical contexts of all the texts we read, and really a hilarious hilarious lecturer. I learned a lot about the conflicting aspects and evolvement of the American century. The class was really interesting to take as an immigrant, and really for anyone. A lot of classic texts that you're always told to read but never get to are included. 10/10 would recommend
This class covers the 1900s-2000s literature of America. Books are: The Sun Also Rises, Giovanni's Room, The Woman Warrior, and The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. Will talk about sexuality, Americanness, travel, cultural differences, and assimilation. Culture is the man as a professor, take it with him
This class is great. Professor Cutler is very funny and does a great job of making the material easy to relate to.
Take this class
Awesome distro! I am such a slow reader and this reading work load was perfect for me. Read four book and some other short stories which I all found super interesting. Cutler is really cool and interesting and does a great job as a lecturer.
Prof Cutler was kind of condescending and I feel like he only chose texts that he felt personal connections to. A lot of his commentary was about books he'd recommend but I don't really see why anyone cares. Also, he'd unnecessarily humiliate students in class if their phone accidentally went off. The books were okay but the final exam is annoying like why not just have a final paper? The TA's also didn't grade equally either.
This is a great English class. The books we read were wonderful (The Sun Also Rises, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, etc.) and effectively cover a wide range of cultural trends and anxieties in 20th century America. Class discussions were interesting and engaging.
The course was very enjoyable, especially the lectures. Professor Cutler is very funny and is a very engaging lecturer
I overall enjoyed this course, but sometimes I felt that many of the topics we related to the book were actually very unrelated and stretching things a bit, so it could get confusing. But it was engaging and challenged you.
This is a great class to take!!! Professor Cutler is amazing and I truly learned a lot
not necessarily an easy A but pretty interesting and good books, professor was awesome
This class was so amazing! Professor Cutler was truly the best professor I have had all year and I would love to take a class with him again! I recommend this class to anyone because the books were very easy reads, the class was pretty laid back, and the professor was extremely engaging and just an all around amazing lecturer and person.
This is seriously an amazing class to take. The texts are enjoyable to read, and Cutler is great
This class was great. 10/10 would recommend for an easy english distro that is interesting. Professor Cutler is incredible. Everything he says makes you want to give him a standing ovation and a kiss. The reading was good, fair amount but doable. Don't miss the quizzes though. The poetry wasn't bad and I really enjoyed reading all of the novels except for Woman Warrior. The two papers are easy and the final is kind of pointless.
Professor Cutler is the man. The books are amazing. I'm a science kid who tried to expand my skills in reading and writing, and this course was perfect.
This is a great class. Not only is it super interesting, the reading is great and Professor Cutler is the best. It's not the most work intensive but I definitely feel like I got something out of it.
Professor Cutler is PHENOMENAL! Take this class! There's a lot of reading but all of the books are amazing and you'll learn so much about various parts of America during the 20th century. Every lecture was so interesting and there was never a dull moment in class!
This was an absolutely amazing course. I thoroughly enjoyed not only all of the texts we read, and Cutler makes incredibly insightful points about each of them and opens your eyes to extremely important but oftentimes subtle textual clues. He's also totally cool and makes class so fun to come to because he's engaging, fun, and easy to connect with. One of the best classes I've taken yet and makes me want to take English throughout my time here.
Professor Cutler is the bomb.
Prof Cutler is funny and engaging and makes class enjoyable! That being said I don't think i learned that much...he kinda just throws themes and vocab words at you and I think the only reason a lot of people go to lecture if because they take attendance...I liked the books and overall a pretty easy/enjoyable class but I had higher expectations given the good CTECs
Great distro. Cutler is an engaging lecturer and the assignments are fairly interesting.
Really interesting books, professor was entertaining in lecture and very good with communication.
The style of this course was extremely conducive: required attendance, key terms, essays
not a lot of work for a lit distro (two 5 page papers and a final), read some interesting books, Professor Cutler is a cool guy
Great distro. Cutler is the best, the work isn't that bad, and the readings are interesting. Definitely a must take class
This course is absolutely fantastic and Prof. Cutler is probably my favorite professor I've had so far. Yes, there is a decent bit of reading, but most books are on Shmoop or Sparknotes. Some of the books are eh re. The Woman Warrior, but other books and short readings are absolutely amazing. Prof. Cutler is so passionate and is honestly just a boss. He makes class fun, and I can't stress that enough, especially from someone who wasn't that hyped about taking the class.
Good Distr
Take a different literature distro. Workload is a bit much, and the quizzes and final can be tough.
This class was amazing. Cutler is a great professor and leads interesting discussions in lecture. HE IS SO WOKE. The readings are pretty easy to understand. Erin was a great TA, she was really helpful and sweet.
I loved Cutler's teaching style--he is absolutely engaging and riveting as a lecturer
A lot of reading, but that should e expected. Loved the materials, hated the essays, although they are pretty reasonable length (4-5 pages). The professors voice was my favorite part of this class; I could literally listen to him talk for hours
Professor was good to listen to during lecture, discussion was a little rough to get through some weeks and are majority offered at night
Too much reading. Readings were lame. Recommend some other teacher even though he is an ok lecturer. Essay required close reading which sucked. Pop-quizes were basic plot but knowing we have a lot of work beside this class, this is pretty much idiotic. 3/10
Overall, solid course. Not too hard, not too easy, very reasonable amount of work assigned. There are probably easier options if you're looking to get an English distro, but this one is good for people who want a good balance of work and difficulty.
Professor Cutler is amazing. He makes the class really enjoyable and engaging and I would recommend this class to anyone interested in modern literature and the construction of American culture. Reading for this class never felt like a chore as all the material was extremely thought provoking and interesting. Also, his slide shows are amazing and technologically incomparable.
Great class, Professor Cutler is great! Love the stuff you read: Hemingway, Junot Dîaz, George Saunders, James Baldwin, Walt Whitman. Definitely a good class to take if you're looking for a way to read these authors.
I recoommend this class to anyone looking for a good, general English class. It is not super high-level, so I think it would be very manageable for non-English majors. It is a good step in determining if you have an interest in the subject and would be interested in taking higher-level courses later on. Overall a great class, great prof and TAs, interesting reads.

Comments
The array of readings covers many different subjects, authors, and time periods. Books include classics like The Sun Also Rises to newer books like the Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. Lecture is engaging and feels like you are in a small seminar class, Professor Cutler learned everyone's names and engages the class through questions throughout lecture.
I really enjoyed the novels we read and I enjoyed the perspective of the narratives. I occasionally felt that if I didn't have the exact same political views as the authors or as the professor, that I was being judged (because the class is very politically charged--which is awesome, but the perspectives we were reading were relatively homogeneous). Cutler was awesome; he's an amazing teacher.
The selection of books and readings in this class is absolutely perfect, and the amount of homework is definitely not too much to handle. Furthermore, Professor Cutler is extremely insightful and adds so much dimension to each of the readings, bringing in history, contemporary issues, and literary allusions in order to enhance the experience of reading the books.
Professor Cutler is a great instruction and I learned a tremendous amount in this class. I came to lecture interested and was not disappointed by the lectures. Professor Cutler brings in a great deal of material outside of the four novels to further edify the course.
I really enjoyed the books we were assigned to read, but sometimes struggled to keep focus during lectures.
Professor Cutler is so chill. I don't know what it is about him that makes me laugh, but lecture was never a struggle to sit through because of him. This was my first english class in college and Iɽ say it's relatively easy and a good distro. I really enjoyed the things we read in this class which also made it a lot more enjoyable. Reading for this class never really felt like a chore.
I loved this course and going to class. I thought the instruction was great and I liked most of the books.
I LOVED almost everything we read in this class, but I disliked Professor Cutler's attitude and teaching style. I found that most of the class was spent listening to other students share their opinions, which were often redundant or uninformed, instead of actually learning from someone with expertise in this field. I don't mind discussion, but not when it is the primary teaching method in a 60-person introductory lecture class. Professor Cutler can also be condescending and definitely thinks because he's a "cool, hip" professor and that gives him license to make poorly timed or mildly inappropriate jokes.
Professor Cutler is awesome - super nice and really passionate and intelligent in regards to the material he teachers. The readings were great (in particular the novels) and overall there is very little time commitment outside of the readings (which take an hour/hour and a half at most and you have 2-3 a week). Grading was very generous as well, but that might've been a TA specific thing.
This class is very good, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an engaging distribution. Professor Cutler is a very intelligent and funny lecturer and I was very lucky to take this class. He is a bit too ambitious in terms of the readings that he assigns, but otherwise its a great class.
I enjoyed the course a ton. Some of the extra readings (poems/short stories) were not always intriguing, but the books were very interesting. I learned a lot about how to analyze texts and think critically.
I loved this course. Professor Cutler is an engaging lecturer and all of the books and short stories were interesting and Professor Cutler did a great job of providing context and meaning to the pieces. I learned so much in this course and really enjoyed class as well as doing my homework. Would definitely recommend.
Fun
This is a good class for distros; it's a pretty easy English class. Lectures are really boring but it's with 10% of the grade so it's an easy A and you might as well go. There's only one short essay, which is rare for an English class. The books we read are actually really good and interesting, and Cutler for the most part is a pretty good lecturer. There are 5 reading quizzes but they're super easy.
This is a great class! Professor Cutler is a fantastic professor who has a lot of passion for what he teaches, and the books we read in class were all very interesting. There were 6 quizzes throughout the quarter, which were easy if you had done the reading, and you can drop your lowest quiz score at the end of the quarter. There was also one essay, one group project, and a final exam.
Professor Cutler is one of the best professors I have had at Northwestern. As a freshman I was told to take one of his courses before I graduated and I took this course now as a senior for fun. He's extremely knowledgable and the way this course was designed was enlightening. I also enjoyed that it was part of the Hewlett diversity initiative. I highly recommend taking this class or any other class with Professor Cutler.
Let's start with grading: I felt I was graded quite harshly on the only essay we had, and I do not think the TA really understood my argument, so I felt frustrated in that respect. The final exam: very, very difficult. I didn't expect it to be so challenging--especially the essay questions at the end. Also, the formatting of the final was not ideal. You had two sections that accounted for 55% of your grade and then a final section that accounted for 45% of your grade. However, I would say you spent 2˳ of your time on the first two sections, and only a third of your time on the essay. Consequently, the grading breakdown should have weighted the first two sections (which were only 55%) more strongly (maybe 66%?) than the final essay section. Also, I though the essay questions were just poorly crafted--I don't think they reflected the themes we studied in the course, and I don't think they gave you a good chance of making a strong argument. I felt shoved into a corner by the essay questions because of how broad and overarching they were (not specific at all). Also, frankly, the story map project was a very bad idea. I appreciate that Cutler was trying to shake up the standard english assignment, but this format just felt forced: like putting a square peg in a round hole. There were various software issues with the Knight Lab story map, and it was really challenging to overcome those pernicious bugs in the software. Let's face it, you should be challenged by the argument you make in your story map and having to work with the text, not the limitations of a software program. So, I felt like that assignment was quite forced and it was not fitting for our course. That being said, I think I also received a very generous grade for the story map. I was surprised that I got a 93, given that our map was not great. So they were lenient there. In terms of instruction, I think Cutler is a good professor and he has a lot of enthusiasm. He does a good job preparing for lecture and bringing in supplementary texts and ideas. I don't think all of his supplementary materials for lecture hit the mark, but I give him credit for trying. I also believe he's well-intentioned with his assignments and overall expectations, so I give him credit there. TAs were very nice--discussion section certainly wasn't mind blowing and I often found it was something I went to out of an obligation rather than interest, but what can you do--they are required. And the last thing I'll say: In terms of subject matter I think this course is effective at bringing in minority voices, but ultimately I think it overlooks the greatest works of American literature in the 20th century. Sure, you've got the Sun Also Rises, and even the Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao (which is a great book, but I don't think it belongs on the list because it was written in 2007!), but Typical American should not be on there. It is a decent work of literature and I do respect Gish Jen, but it certainly has no place in a course that surveys strong works of American Literature of the 20th century--it is nowhere near the quality of other works of American literature which I would have liked to see appear in this course; to name a few: Ellison's the Invisible Man, anything by Faulkner (Light in August, the Sound and the Fury, short fiction such as Barn Burning or A Rose for Emily), Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, Cather's My Antonia, Hansberry's A raisin in the Sun, Wright's Native Son, the list goes on! I give Cutler credit for trying to incorporate minority voices into a narrative of American literature that has been dominated by white writers, but I still question his choices. There is so much in the way of literature written and based on non-white voices: Richard Wright! Sherman Alexie! Amy Tan! Lastly, I can't mention these stories without expressing my loathing for Flowering Judas by Katherine Anne Porter; I don't even know where to begin there, but I really wish we hadn't read that story especially because it's connections to American literature, in my opinion, are somewhat dubious (again you could have thrown in a Faulkner short story or another Baldwin essay in its place). Anyways, respect to Cutler for trying to open the narrative and broaden the historically exclusive white-dominated canon--he hit the mark with some assignments like the yusef komunyakaa poems, countee cullen poems, Baldwin readings, Larsen's Passing, but I would have liked to see some better picks overall if you are going to teach a course in 20th century America literature--this was more of a class about minority voices in literature (a la Cutler) since the 1920s then it was a course on 20th century American literature. For those of you reading this down the road, I suggest you look at the syllabus and course readings beforehand, so you know what you're getting to. The title of the class is deceiving, and in the end the books and readings make the course not the professor and the TAs. I always say you can enjoy a class with a bad professor but strong subject matter, but you can't enjoy a class with a good professor and bad subject matter. This class was a case of a good professor and decent subject matter--but again, the poems, readings, and supplementary material mean everything, so get to know the syllabus before you throw yourself into this class.
Professor Cutler is one of the best at NU and this class offers a great mix of authors like Hemingway and contemporary voices such as Junot Díaz.
All the readings are interesting (especially the books; the books are awesome) and teach you something new about some of the problems that were present in the 20th century. The reading quizzes are fairly easy if you read although some can get a little tricky. Usually if you put something that sort of makes sense then they will give you full points. The first analytical project is a paper which is difficult because it is a close reading of a text. I did not do a great job yet still got a B which was fine. The second project is a group project and that was really good and fun. The final is difficult but made sense and ultimately this is a great english class. Thoroughly enjoyed it!!!!!!!!!!
Good basic introduction class/requirement :)
not an easy course but the professor has some insightful thoughts on the course material and there is knowledge to be gained; a solid amount of reading that must be done to keep up with the class and the quasi-weekly quizzes; however doing just this much (reading, quizzes and class notes) makes the midterm paper and final exam fair (but not easy); group project in addition to midterm paper and final exam is not tough.
AMAZING teacher. SUPER interesting material. would highly recommend.
Everything about this course was wonderful and you should all take this course.
LITERALLY THE BEST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN AT NU! I was not thrilled about enrolling in a literature class because they tend to be centered on white folks and seldom include the narratives of POC. But this class was a pleasant surprise! There was so much diverse literature. In each class Professor Cutler asked questions that made us think about race. Sometimes it was a conversation with a character in the book that could easily be glanced over but had greater meaning in understanding the novel. Cutler is an amazing lecturer and the lectures are structured. Everything about the course is amazing. My TA was the best! S/O to Delali. I CANNOT SAY THIS ENOUGH- If you are hesitant to take a literature course because you feel like they tend to center on and celebrate whiteness, this class does not. PLEASE TAKE IT.Especially my POC. Its Lit!
It was fascinating to be taught that so many American issues are the fault of society far more than they are the responsibility of the individual. Our discussions over how affairs can liberate oppressed women from heteropatriarchal structures proved especially fascinating.
I liked this class because we read literature (books, poems, and short stories) from a diverse set of authors, which meant the course incorporated many different perspectives. You have to make sure to keep up with the reading in order to follow class discussions and do well on the pop quizzes. Grading depends on the TA. I thought the project and paper were interesting, and it intimidated me a little bit to have an in-class final exam, but if you keep up with the reading and you take good in-class notes you'll feel prepared.
Good class for a distro, learned a lot around the theme of class/race/gender˾tc divisions in America
Professor Cutler is great, the course content is extremely interesting.
Professor Cutler is very engaging and charismatic, albeit a bit fake. His lectures are always incredibly interesting. However, some of the texts he chose were painful to drag through.
Lectures were always engaging, as were discussion sections. I was a big fan of the readings and Professor Cutler does a great job of teaching students how to analyze literature according to historical and cultural context.
Professor Cutler is a great professor, and while the class is fast paced, I found the readings to be enjoyable.
This class was great! I've never really enjoyed an English class, but this class I actually looked forward to attending most weeks. I loved all of the materials we read in class and the professor was really cool. The class was also graded very fairly, so as long as you actually did the readings (which most people did anyways since it was always interesting), then the quizzes were a breeze.
WONDERFUL CLASS. Prof Cutler is extremely eloquent and engaging--lecture was very enjoyable and the readings were also great. Make sure to keep up with them though, because the reading quiz grade could pull down your overall grade quite a bit. Decent amount of reading, but manageable and so interesting!!
This is such a good class. Professor Cutler is such a dynamic lecturer. The books are fairly quick reads and the whole class is really interesting.
Solid lit distro.
The class was well scheduled. The readings were never too long and were interesting. The quizzes help you stay on top of everything. Discussion sessions were interesting. Cutler is the most amazing professor...cannot recommend him enough!!
This class was a great english class for people who are interested in modern literature and the cross-section between english and history. Most of the readings were really interesting and not too challenging. The work was manageable (especially for an english class where there could be a lot of reading). The quizzes were very fair and it is relatively easy to do well if you attend class and discussion because participation˺ttendance encompasses 25% of your grade. GREAT DISTRO.
Professor Cutler is incredibly kind, and does a nice job of making his lectures easy to follow and interesting.
Cutler is an engaging speaker, reading quizzes are not hard, discussion group is good
I was pleasantly surprised by the multiple aspects we took on as a class to be understand what exactly "The American Century" was. I loved most of the readings and how the intersectional stories further explained a complete picture of what America was and in some ways continues to be. Loved the enthusiasm of the class, would recommend.
I really liked this class. I enjoyed all of the books we read, and lectures were always really interesting.
Amazing english class, would highly recommend for a distro. Lectures were interesting and were a combination of lit and history. The books, short stories, and poems were amazing, and we read work by all different authors -- rather than just straight white old men, like you sometimes do in a Lit class. Reading was easy, just one essay, a project, a final, and five quizzes in class that were fine if you did the reading or read summaries online.
This class was way better than I expected it to be and I really enjoyed the required reading and the lectures complimented them. This professor is awesome. Definitely take this class!
Professor Cutler is a great lecturer and the class was a manageable amount of reading with great texts. There were a handful of reading quizzes that were easy to do well on as long as you did the readings, but there's only a few big assignments that make it hard to make up your grade if you don't get A's.
This is a great class! Professor Cutler is kind and encourages student participation. I learned a lot about issues such as race, gender, and violence and how they evolved over the past 100 years or so. I also liked the variety of projects that we got to do.
English-273 provides a really interesting reading into some really great books. As long as you keep up with the reading, you'll be intrigued in class. I gained a much deeper appreciation for English and as a result, am now considering it as a major.
This course was extraordinarily effective in exploring the 20th century through the lens of diverse writers and thinkers, offering a brand new perspective to a seemingly fossilized period of American history. I loved reading American literature that covered a broad swath of American life, and found this extremely valuable in reexamining what I thought I knew about America.
The texts were definitely different than what I thought they were going to be, but helped me look at the American experience from a multicultural perspective. A fair bit of reading, but totally interesting and worth it.
Awesome course, as long as you go to lecture and discussions should be an easy A
I can't say enough good things about this class. The lectures are fascinating, the reading material is amazing, the TAs are great and Professor Cutler is the most amazing teacher in the world. There's a lot of reading but it's manageable, there are only two major assignments and one final, along with a few reading quizzes that are easy if you've done the reading. Take this class!!!!
Cutler is a very knowledgable professor on the subject, is a well-prepared lecturer, and this class had a lot of potential. Unfortunately, the political views and textual interpretations of the instructors were basically presented to us as fact and jammed down our throats. If you write a well-argued paper from a viewpoint that doesn't line up with your TA, your grade will suffer as a result. There is little tolerance for opposing viewpoints in this class.
Professor Cutler is an amazing professor. He's clearly very interested in the course material and uses a bit of humor here and there to keep the class interesting. I personally thoroughly enjoyed the readings that we did (not much of a poem person, but the novels and short stories we read were definitely up my alley). Cutler's array of readings were obviously intended to cover the American experience from diverse racial perspectives, and he covers a bit of American history in lecture as context for the novels, which I found helpful. The comprehension quizzes in class are easy if you've done the reading.

Comments
The professor cared about us and didn’t try and over complicate unnecessarily.
Seth is a fun professor, really makes the material accessible. The course often felt like it was more about each of the individual adaptations we looked at, rather than adaptation as a subject
Seth is a really good guy and cares about his students. As for the content of the course, it was a little too political/historical for my taste. Papers didn't really have prompts but were just different types of papers, which was helpful for working on close reading.
I really enjoyed this course. Great teacher. Not too hard, the readings are fun but you can get by without them (not recommended). I enjoyed the structure of this class. The marrying between theatre and english was lovely.
Seth is a super awesome and hilarious guy and I would definitely recommend taking a class with him. He was definitely the best part of the class. Obviously if you don't like Shakespeare you wouldn't be interested in this because the entire class revolves around his works and adaptations. The class is only a 2-page paper, a 4-5 page paper, a 8-9 final page paper, and a discussion leading session where you lead the class for 20 minutes with a partner. The reading and workload was pretty manageable. Seth is not an easy grader but all of his comments for each of our essays were very helpful and for the final paper he even allowed us to submit an extended bibliography and then a rough draft which was super helpful. You can also always email him with questions if you're having trouble and need help with your writing. He's a super nice guy and genuinely wanted everyone in the class to succeed. The only thing I didn't love about the class was I wish that the movies we watched were better and more of the very popular Shakespeare adaptations (like the Lion king, romeo + juliet, 10 things i hate about you). I didn't like any of the films except for Scotland PA, however all of the readings were either classic Shakespeare (Macbeth, Hamlet, King Lear, sonnets) or some sort of adaptation which was interesting. I'm not a huge Shakespeare person but the class was still fun and it was interesting to see what inspired Shakespeare and what works were inspired by him. Overall I would recommend this or another class with Seth because he was a great professor and I learned a lot.
The class was fun and Seth is great, but overall it wasn't very interesting or challenging and I didn't learn anything new. It wasn't exactly an easy A, but it was an easy class.
interesting readings, chill professor, lots of discussion, i really liked it
I loved this class a lot. Professor Swanner is one of the best professors I've ever had. He is so funny and engaging, and also makes himself extremely available for questions or just to talk with students. He is truly wonderful, and everyone should absolutely take a class with him if you have the opportunity, he is just the best. The structure of the class itself was also great. The course material was extremely varied but never felt disparate or unrelated. We spent just enough time on each text, so it never felt like we read or watched something for no reason, but also never felt like we were beating a dead horse. I loved this class, absolutely take it if its something you're interested in.
Personally am not a fan of Shakespeare, but this class is made bearable because Seth is one of the most awesome English teachers at Northwestern. He is fun to talk to, clear with his expectations and instructions, offers very useful feedback, and brings 120% enthusiasm to every class. He appreciates what big or little contribution you made in class.
I liked the course overall, but it was a little boring sometimes. I think this is mostly because early modern texts can be dull and hard to access.. Also basically every class professor Swanner decided to re-teach us how to support claims with textual evidence which became redundant. A lot of the activities and games we had to do weren't really engaging, just a way to force people to dig through their books to support crazy claims. After the 3rd or 4th time, we get it.

This was a great class. If you're a theatre major looking to fulfill a His/Lit˼rit class, take this. You read four tragedies and write 3 papers - a short response paper, a midterm, and then a final one. Most of the class is discussion. Sucich is a bit of a tough grader - not unreasonably so, but you need to pay attention and be a fairly good writer. He's really enthusiastic during class and good at facilitating discussion.
This class was fantastic. Even though I didn't take this class for any requirement, I didn't feel like it was inaccessible for non-English majors. The lectures were both thoughtful and thought-provoking, and I gained insight into the plays we read that I've never considered before. The assignments were very manageable, and we were encouraged to write on any topics that interested us, rather than having set requirements for a paper.
The Glenn Sucich is an amazing teacher who really piques your interest in the Shakespearean tragedies. If you do the assigned readings and read the given text, you will have no problem keeping up in class. I loved how the class was mainly a discussion rather than a lecture, but it also means you need to speak up, even if you may feel your critical insight is not as wow-worthy as others'. The final research essay (7-8 pages of original writing or 9-10 pages including research based on a previous essay) was really not that bad at all.
I appreciated how engaged and interesting the lectures were. It felt very worth while to come to class.
This class was slightly disappointing. I'm an English major, and I feel that the class catered too much to the large number of theater students in the class. There was, in my opinion, not enough literary analysis, and too much generality. One of the major problems is that the professor would allow the theater students to talk for almost the entire class, which was irritating because the discussions would invariably devolve into boring nonsense. This was particularly annoying because Prof. Sucich is clearly very knowledgeable and passionate about Renaissance literature, and I would have liked to hear more about what he thought about the plays. There was one class on Macbeth where he went through the sounds of the play (i.e., assonance and consonance and alliteration) which was by far the best class and should have been the model for every class.
This is a great course to read Shakespeare's greatest plays. I would recommend it to anyone with any amount of experience with Shakespeare, whether they like Shakespeare or not.
I loved coming to this class. Glenn is always so passionate and enthusiastic about the work we're doing and genuinely wants to hear what people have to say. We read Othello, King Lear, Macbeth, and Coriolanus, but I think heɽ be willing to change the tragedies depending on class preference. He places a lot of value in class participation and most of the class is based on discussion. He was very reasonable in assigning reading -- we usually read each play over the course of a week and a half and discussed the acts separately before addressing the plays as a whole. If you're at all interested in Shakespeare, definitely take this class because it's stimulating and there's something in it for everyone.
This is an amazing course. A fair amount of reading (4 Shakespeare plays in 1 quarter), but balanced out with only a couple papers and really interesting discussions of the topics in the plays and why they are still relevant today. Prof. Sucich is an amazing lecturer, made the course extremely engaging, and made himself available to meet for extremely helpful office hours.
I LOVED THIS COURSE! Professor Sucich is fabulous and really funny, he knows the material so well and drops really brilliant knowledge as if it was obvious. This was a great course and made me look at texts Iɽ already read in a new light.
Glenn is a fantastic professor. Every class with him is extremely interesting, and enjoyable to attend. There is a perfect balance between lecture and discussion, and I left the class feeling much more knowledgable about the works of Shakespeare.
GREAT PROFESSOR. Sometimes lets students dictate too much of the conversation in my opinion. I also hated Shakespeare going into the class and hoped Glenn would be able to change my mind, but he didn't and I still hate Shakespeare.
Great course! Professor Sucich offers really interesting insights into Shakespeare.
This is an amazing class; all the class discussions were involved, casual, yet intellectual. Prof. Sucich developed a culture in the classroom where people talked about what they found interesting or cool about the plays and how those ideas or concepts related to the world at large. The reading was not a crazy amount because it was paced very well. 10⼐
Prof Sucich is absolutely great! So enthusiastic and knowledgeable! Very lax about extensions with papers. A lot of reading and just a few papers, so not too much work, but a fair amount. Great class though, and great professor. Would absolutely recommend.
This is a great, great, great course for Shakespearean tragedies. Prof. Sucich is an amazing professor who clearly loves and understands the plays. Discussions were always engaging and interesting, and the chosen plays were all incredible as well. 10⼐, would recommend to anyone with a vague interest in Shakespeare or the most robust Shakespeare lover
Great professor! Loved the class discussions and essay feedback was VERY helpful.
This class was fantastic and an amazing entry into Shakespeare if you haven't read his works previously. Glenn is a spectacular, engaging professor. My only complaint would be that he often let the class discussions be managed by a select group of theater majors who honestly didn't ever say anything all that interesting. I think if the class' orientation was shifted, ever so slightly, back towards English and focusing on talking about different scholars' interpretations of Shakespeare would make this class truly great. Overall, definitely an easier English class and you can watch the stage productions alongside reading the plays which makes understanding them 10000% easier.
Great class on Shakespeare's tragedies!! Glenn is such an engaging, funny, kind, wonderful prof--highly highly recommend any of his courses. A couple of students tended to dominate the discussion, but Glenn was always able to reign in back in and I felt like I really learned a lot about engaging with the tragedies. Definitely recommend this class!!

Comments
I already loved Hamlet before going into this course, and I still love it heading out. We focused a little too much on analyzing other people's analysis for me, though. It felt as though all our discussion in class wasn't about the play, but about different critical papers about it. I ended up considering it more of a class on comparing different critical theories by how they each deal with one text instead of a class on that text. I didn't have a problem with that, but it wasn't what I was expecting, so I thought that was probably a fair thing to mention here in case anyone else thought similarly. That said, I found discussing the history of the play to be one of my favorite things. I especially loved being able to see old quartos and folios from the special collections library one class.
Professor Masten provides challenging and interesting courses while making himself a resource. Loved focusing on one play, getting to really evaluate it from different perspectives!!
Professor Masten is a fabulous instructor and I would highly recommend that all English majors take a course with him before graduating. You will learn so much in his class. The fact that he was able to so easily hold a class's attention while spending an entire quarter on one play is a feat in itself; bringing to life a course focused on literary theory and criticism is another. He fostered a great deal of enthusiasm among the students and the discussions we had in class were really fascinating. It was both a challenging and deeply enjoyable course.
TL;DR **take this course** super interesting, amazing prof, stay on top of readings and it's not really that much work, not just for Shakespeare/theater buffs
Amazing course!! Not offered very often, so if it is, jump on it before it fills up. Prof. Masten is one of the best professors I've had in my time here so far -- engaging, supportive, all around an amazing teacher. The classes where he lectured weren't dull in the slightest, and he tried to keep them mainly discussion-based so that wasn't many. As someone who is sometimes intimidated by "MUST TALK EVERY CLASS FOR PARTICIPATION" situations, this was not like that at all -- Prof. Masten appreciates when you talk, but he also keeps an eye out for general engagement, paying attention, understanding of material in papers etc. so I didn't feel pressured to participate just for the sake of contributing something (and I ended up talking most classes anyway, based on the wonderful atmosphere and feeling like I legitimately had things to say). I went to office hours several times and Prof. Masten was incredibly helpful -- would also recommend getting to know him outside of class. 
Iɽ read Shakespeare before but had never done Hamlet, and had never had much intellectually stimulating discussing of the plays Iɽ read (@high school English), so this seemed like a good distro to go with to get a better understanding of the Bard while I knocked out my VI. Little intimidating at first but, although there were a lot of theater kids, I didn't feel out of place at all after a while. Not really that much work, either; a good number of readings, but perfectly reasonable in quantity, that introduce a variety of schools of thought about reading literature -- absolutely fascinating. Three papers, two in the middle and then a final.
Hamlet is one of my "special interests" so I was excited to take a class for 9 weeks where that's all we talked about. The secondary sources were pretty long and high level, a bit of a chore to plow through, but the discussions were always interesting. I knew Hamlet was culturally far-reaching, but I didn't realize how far exactly. It also made me think about how things like literature can be a foray into the way people thought and lived in the past, which I hadn't thought about as in depth before. Focusing on one play for three months wasn't difficult because I love it, but also the discussions were so varied that it stayed interesting. I recommend if you like combination of lit and history.
I loved the diversity of sources and anaytical lenses we used to interpret Hamlet. I wish the class were structured so that there was less all-class discussion because with everyone talking at once, some people dominated conversations while others said nothing.
This course has a lot of really challenging reading but is really instructive in thinking about critical theories and lenses. It is a lot of work and a lot of Hamlet in a short period of time, but I learned a lot.
Definitely not a course for the faint of heart, as it is challenging, but 100% is rewarding. No other class at Northwestern has improved my critical reading and writing as much as this has, if only because the atmosphere Masten cultivates is one where no ideas are stupid, and every idea can be pushed and stretched and elevated even further than you could initially imagine. Take this course if you love Shakespeare, or Hamlet, or want to think critically about one work and the wide-ranging implications of it throughout history. Very highly recommended.
Professor Masten is great! He is funny and smart, but unfortunately not even his fun energy could mask the fact that this class is absolutely boring. The readings are dull and hard, and I spent most of my class time trying not to fall asleep. If you love studying the differences in grammar between text written in 1604 and 1603, then this is the class for you.
Do you care about Hamlet? Answer that before you take this. Masten’s the best though.
This course made me learn a text in a way I had never learned a singular text before. The papers were graded very harshly, it's not that it was unfair, just harsh. This class was great, but not for the faint of heart.
It is an interesting course! A lot of reading however. Masten is very intelligent though it is cool to hear his thoughts. He also makes a lot of jokes which keeps the mood light. I was not an english major, so this course scared me initially but I ended up enjoying it a lot.
This is an English class, not a theater class! There is an intense focus on critical readings and intellectual approaches to Shakespeare's opus. Scholars, like Professor Masten, know their stuff and have created strong theories about how to interpret Hamlet, which is so cool! Read the class description to see if you want to take this class.
It was really amazing tos pend a whole quarter delving into one Shakespeare play and I feel like I got a lot out of it as a result. Professor Masten is such an expert on Shakespeare and great at guiding the course. The readings were all really interesting and gave a really nice array of critical perspectives on Hamlet. Prof. Masten is also really good at helping develop analytical skills by showing you how to approach complicated critical essays in terms of argument, method, and evidence. The paper topics were helpful in guiding the writing process, but also gave you the flexibility to write about what you were passionate about. My only critique is that it took Prof. Masten a long time to return the first paper (although he had a lot of other stuff happening this quarter, so you can't hold it against him too much). Overall great course, great professor, learned a lot.

Comments
Professor did not provide a clear syllabus or grade breakdown, nor was the Canvas page ever opened up for the course. While the syllabus provided at the beginning of the course had readings listed by day, the professor would often announce at the start of a session that we would be instead discussing a different play that day. Since no prior information via email or Canvas was given, the majority of students were unable to participate as they had not been able to read the proper play for that particular session. It was unclear whether the professor understood how much of an issue this was, as many sessions were dull (the bulk of classtime was devoted to students reading aloud sections of a play), as students cannot discuss plays that they haven’t read. Classes often ended 10-20 minutes early, which made the course feel unfocused. Professor did not engage with all student comments, focusing primarily on those that reflected his reading of the material. Course felt designed to discourage participation.
The course material itself was very interesting--if you're already interested in Shakespeare or early modern drama in general. I enjoyed the focus on gender politics and representation, and it was useful to read such a broad sampling of Shakespeare's plays to understand trends in his work over time. Drawing connections and comparisons between˺mong plays was a good approach.


However, that is about all that I can say positively about the course. The professor's disorganization and unrealistic expectations made it very frustrating. Class time was almost completely devoted to reading aloud and group discussion, which is absolutely normal and good for an English class, but two factors prevented the discussions from becoming very valuable:


1) Prof. Erickson repeatedly departed from the reading schedule on the syllabus. This made it extremely difficult to have good discussions, because obviously most students didn't have much to contribute regarding plays we hadn't read yet. The first time, several of us explicitly said we hadn't read the play he was talking about because it wasn't on the syllabus for that week, but it still happened two or three more times throughout the course, with no warning.


2) Prof. Erickson also very obviously expected that the students who enrolled would have more background knowledge and literary analysis skills than they did. He was prepared to teach a 300-level English class on Shakespeare, but since the course was cross-listed in Humanities and had no prerequisites, there were lots of underclassmen, theater majors, etc. This is not a bad thing at all! It's great to have perspectives other than English majors who've taken all the same Shakespeare courses over the years... but Prof. Erickson did not adapt his teaching. Often his questions were difficult to parse, for those of us who aren't as familiar with the scholarly language of Elizabethan drama, and he assumed that we had read other Shakespeare plays when we had not. So there were a LOT of long, awkward silences in our discussions.


The IDEA of the course and the materials are very good, and I certainly learned by reading and writing about the plays, but I couldn't recommend the course as taught by Prof. Erickson with the structure that it has. Should've had some prerequisites (not necessarily Intro to Shakespeare, but at least one of the Foundations of Brit˺m Lit courses or something similar) so that students would be prepared with the expected skills for productive discussion.
The workload is very minimal, and the professor is clearly passionate about the subject. The two major assignments are open ended enough to allow creativity in your thesis and the texts are engaging. The lectures can be boring and it was sometimes difficult to find the motivation to attend, however.
This is both the least productive and least enjoyable class I have ever taken at northwestern. I went to class every class (which is more than most can say as the 40 person class dropped to 17 after one class and by mid quarter literally 4-8 people showed up to each class because of how bad it was) and just counted the minutes until I could leave. The professor was never prepared and never seemed to have any idea what he was talking about. I was constantly bored and confused because he would somehow seem to talk about nothing for an hour and a half twice a week. I can not warn you enough DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Whatever requirement is may fulfill for you I promise there is a better way to do it.

Comments
The discussions are in-depth, thought-provoking and interesting, but the readings are so heavy that they're simply unreasonable at some points. As much as I enjoyed the class, I would only recommend it to someone who isn't taking any other intensive, time-consuming courses this quarter.
– It was refreshing to have a lit class where you primarily read, without all the literary criticism and group presentations and canvas posts. It can be an intimidating atmosphere for a quiet student, but Prof. Herbert values each student's contribution and never makes anyone feel inadequate in their comments. He is extremely knowledgable and passionate about Dickens, and even though the works can be dense and there is a lot lot of reading, it's a good feeling to leave a NU course and feel that you have accomplished something. Many english classes these days are focused on more contemporary / non-canonical works, and while those are great too, it was good to read some major classics. Got so much more out of the novels than I would have alone, and they are incredible. Class presentations and paper is manageable. But reading is a lot; be warned.
This is an incredibly reading-intensive course. Be prepared to read a lot. But if you like reading, and Dickens, it is an absolute blast.
I was really excited to take this course because I love Dickens, but it was such a heavy workload that I felt like I didn't have time to actually absorb what I was reading and that I still need to read all the novels again to understand them. Honestly, not worth taking unless you are capable of reading VERY quickly and still understanding. Professor Herbert was nice and the course wasn't too hard, but it was a lot of undue stress.
Amazing course (one of the best English courses at NU) but LOTS OF READING BEWARE.
SO MUCH READING but good books.

Comments
Fascination, reading pleasure, deep emotions, great entrance into Dickensian world!!
The discussion in the course provides an all-rounded insight into three of Dickens's works.
The course was very reading-intensive, but definitely worth it. The discussion of the material was always interesting and engaging.
Take any class with Prof Hebert if you haven't!!!!!! The class is really reading-heavy, but 100% worth it!
Cannot recommend this course highly enough for anyone interested at all in literature. Professor Herbert is phenomenal at letting you just read the books and come to conclusions that you can share in an open and safe environment. The books, written 150 years ago, are made ever so relevant and pertinent by his style of teaching. Love this class.
This was a truly excellent class. Christopher Herbert is extremely passionate and knowledgeable on the subject of Charles Dickens and facilitated great discussions by always asking in depth and provocative questions. He is also very kind and encouraging. It is a lot of reading but totally worth it!
There is a lot of reading, but the books themselves are entertaining and insightful. As long as you put in work you will do fine.
I wouldn't want to study Dickens with anyone else! Professor Herbert's classes are incredibly engaging and insightful and I'm convinced everyone becomes a better student by taking them. I am always amazed by the conclusions that we seem to come to as a class under Professor Herbert's guidance - reading a book in his class is a completely different experience. I also loved reading some of the non-conventional Dickens novels.
Herbert knows a lot about Dickens. It's a lot of reading -- maybe 400 pages a week, and it's dense. The assignments outside of the hefty reading, though, are minimal, and class is discussion-based without real structure. I personally found this pretty frustrating, since I didn't feel like I was being taught.

Comments
Awesome class. Class is very interesting, and with a manageable workload. Great, diverse choice of reading material, and allows rewrites for essays, so your writing skills improve.
LOVED THIS CLASS!!! Bill Savage has the most unique style of reading novels I've experienced at NU and I had so much to learn in this class. Really great texts chosen and class discussions are incredibly dynamic. Savage is so flexible with how the class is tested in terms of paper due date scheduling, and I've never had a professor make his students' wishes such a high priority. This class is designed around the specific students in the class, could not recommend more.
Savage has clear expectations while still providing options for students. He approaches the text with great knowledge of its background and interaction with modern America. His class discussions are meaningful, and allow for students to contribute fully without getting off topic. There's a lot of reading to do, but all of the texts are good reads so it doesn't feel laborious.
I loved this course and found it very compelling. The books we read were fascinating and chronologically painted a very interesting development of American identity over time. I was challenged intellectually and in course conversations, and found the discussions we had in the class some of the most engaging discussions I've had in any Northwestern class.
This course kicked my butt. I'm a sophomore poli sci major and this is my first college english class. I was definitely way underqualified for this course, but it was also one of the most rewarding classes I've ever taken. I learned TONS about America, and myself, and how I think about the world. I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED, this class, but don't take it if you're looking for a relaxed english distro with a famous sex-advice columnist's brother.
Bill is an understandable, understanding, and engaging professor to be in class with. He makes discussions fun and the books we read were really thought-provoking. Never a time where I didn't enjoy this course.
I expected this to be a challenging course that would make my writing better. It did that and more. I really appreciated the opportunities to re-write papers because I felt that really helped me gain a better idea of how to improve future papers. I also think the response papers allowed me to read the novels more closely and pick up on things I never would have. Class discussions were always very interesting and I always looked forward to what Professor Savage had to say about the novels we read.
I think this class does not present many different opinions of America,
This course can be hard at times and necessitates a lot of reading, but the discussions in class are worth putting in the effort. Professor Savage delves into what being an American means, and how identity serves as a critical component of the American experiences. The class not only engaged me, but his edits on my essay really provided good criticism to improve my writing in the future.
Excellent course, especially for a non-English major like myself. One of the best courses I've taken at Northwestern, gives you a newfound appreciation of reading novels, and a better understanding of the American literary canon. You get to explore really interesting concepts of identity as well as various ways new ways to understand literature.
Prof. Savage is amazing and course texts were interesting. ~1 book/week, so there's significant work out of class. Savage gives a lot of options for course assignments to work with different types of students.
I LOVED THIS CLASS. This was my favorite course I've taken at Northwestern. I really enjoyed getting to read a wide variety of American novels, even if it was often one novel per week, which can be taxing. It's predominantly a discussion class, so you'll get a lot more out of it if you do the reading and talk. Bill Savage is a great professor and he includes some interesting lectures on what it means to be a part of a literary canon.
I would recommend this course to anyone at Northwestern, even people who aren't majoring in English. I learned more in this class than I think I learned in my entire junior year. Everything feels relevant and contemporary.
This course is challenging but Professor Savage is excellent. Don't take it if you're not willing to do a decent amount of reading. If you don't read the novels you won't get anything out of the class.
awesome course
As close to a "life-changing class" I've had at NU. Bill Savage is brilliant, and if you're game for some fast-moving, intricate discussions about identity/the texts, you'll love this class. It's challenging; Bill's a tough grader, but he takes pains to explain what makes a successful argument, paper, sentence, etc. It's a time commitment, too, roughly one novel a week (except a little breather around Weeks 5 and 6, which is nice) but it's one of the most rewarding experiences I've had at NU. Take this class!
I'm working on a creative writing minor, so I sort of had to take this class, but it ended up being one of the most interesting classes I've taken at Northwestern. I knew coming into this class that it would be a challenge — I've never taken a 300-level English class before — and felt that I was able to improve my critical reading and writing skills, which was my main goal. I felt the one drawback was that the class discussions moved too quickly. Often, the class was on its second or third ɽirect response' by the time I could think of something to say for the original statement. Other than that this class met or surpassed all of my expectations.
This is one of the best, if not the best, classes I've taken at Northwestern. It made me think in new ways about what it means to be American, and about how this country has evolved since its conception. The weekly reading responses made me stay up to date with the reading and hone my writing skills. The class discussions were some of the most interesting I've ever participated in -- I'm not sure whether that was a result of the students in the class or Professor Savage's teaching style or both. The classes were a mix of open discussion about the texts and Professor Savage lecturing about the historical context of what we had read. If you want to sharpen your reading and writing skills AND learn a ton about American history, take this class.
Again, I loved all the material Professor Savage used in this class, as he presented totally unique views on works that students are likely to have encountered before
This is a fantastic course. TAKE IT. There's an awesome reading list and Professor Savage is the best English teacher I've had at Northwestern. This course does require a significant amount of reading - about a novel a week - but it's so worth it. This class made me consider the American identity in ways that I never had before. Plus, there are lots of options for how you are evaluated in the class - Professor Savage allows you to choose how many essays you want to write for the class and then weights them accordingly. Great for all levels of writers because of that. The discussion was always engaging and very thought-provoking. Cannot stress this enough. This is a wonderful class and you should TAKE IT.

Comments
This course opened my eyes to a more global view of "coming of age" - great syllabus. I really enjoyed it.
Really enjoyed this class!! I genuinely enjoyed all of the novels we read, and discussion was productive. Prof. Johnson was great!
Professor Johnson was really interested in teaching intersectionality and while I really commend her for doing so, as a student of color it felt very basic and often the professor wasn't great at challenging students on their perceptions of topics like race and gender, which lead to certain students saying wild statements in class without the professor commenting at all. This wasn't helped by the fact that class is based entirely around student run discussion, which could range from really great and insightful to utterly quiet.
Pretty good course, the professor clearly cares and put a lot of effort into finding some great reading selections
This is my favorite English class I have taken at NU so far. Professor Johnson is amazing– she is very friendly and passionate, but also expects a lot from her students and is good at inspiring everyone to give their full attention and efforts to the class. I found the reading and assignments to be manageable, and Professor Johnson was great at teaching without preaching/lecturing– she let students lead the discussion while still guiding us and helping us see things from a new point of view. She also helped us unpack and think more critically about ideas like intersectionality, representation and diversity that people tend to throw around but don't always fully understand. The materials we read were incredibly interesting, and I found that Professor Johnson was a very fair grader for students that participated, did the reading and engaged with the concepts. This course tackles incredibly important issues and everyone should take it!
Professor Johnson is a really thoughtful and helpful professor, and it's clear she really cares about her students. The texts we read were great and the work was manageable, yet interesting. Recommend!
Excellent syllabus/materials. Usually survey-type courses (variety of materials˻ig range) are all over the place, but the themes of the course were clearly applied for each and every reading. I found this course extremely valuable and it's the best English class I've taken. Prof Johnson is great to meet with during office hours and genuinely wants you to improve your writing. Discussions are really relevant to current events and I think 10⼐ would recommend this class.
Typical NU english class. Prof Johnson is helpful and the books we read were interesting but everything discussed was pretty expected and I didn't feel like I learned anything groundbreaking.
There were some days of interesting discussion in this class, however on the whole I was not a huge fan of the subject matter. Didn't have to do a ton of the readings to be able to participate. I did not think the assignments reflected the tone or discourse of the class at all, especially because the instructions for each assignment were so rigid but the grading was easy.
–
This was such a good class!! The materials were really interesting and Professor Johnson was amazing! The work itself was not very challenging and the class discussions were interesting, definitely worth taking
This class covered such interesting stories. I enjoyed nearly all of the materials we read, and I definitely see this class impacting my future literary career at Northwestern and beyond.
Professor Johnson is wonderful! She is super helpful and kind. She really prioritizes supporting and engaging students. I recommend this class.
People really do not know what intersectionality is! A hard class to take with wealthy, straight, white people!!
The texts/materials in this course were very enjoyable, but I wasn't so sure they were all that interesting to talk about. The texts kind of speak for themselves, so class discussion seemed pretty relaxed and not super consequential, but it was nice that way. Professor Johnson does an amazing job at facilitating the class and is definitely a natural when it comes to being insightful, as well as letting students talk. Taking a class with her is worthwhile and I would do it again.

Comments
Stern is an amazing professor, but she expects a lot from students. If you don't realistically plan to read four Faulkner novels in one quarter, you're going to get left behind. But if you're jazzed about reading Faulkner, you'll get a ton out of this class.
This class is a ton of reading - 4 Faulkner books in less than ten weeks is not an easy task. It's important to do the readings, as almost every class is a discussion. Prof Stern is a great professor. She is brilliant and really encouraging
Every English major has said that you have to take this course before you graduate. I'm really glad I did. The course material is intellectually challenging (it is Faulkner) but extremely important. Definitely have to read all the material to enjoy or understand the discussion in class. This is not a class where you can expect to "get by" with skimming, because Prof. Stern wants everyone to talk and discuss (participation is 25%). There is only one 7-8 page final paper and two take-home exams in the course. The exams are close-reading so they're a bit tricky but are super manageable (i.e. take 1.5 hours) if you have taken really good notes all quarter.
The number of readings can be overwhelming at times but if you try to set personal goals for when to have each book finished, you'll be okay (maybe try books on tape as well). Faulkner's writing can be very disorienting so take your time. Professor Stern is an absolutely fabulous professor, she knows a lot about Faulkner and the academic theories surrounding literature but she's also very open to hearing new interpretations from the students.
This class is pretty tough but it's worth it; the novels are hard to get through but Professor Stern is incredible and the class discussions can be really interesting when people are engaged
I love Professor Stern so much. Please take classes with her if you are an English major and if you aren't one then please take a class with her. She is brilliant and kind and funny and perceptive and just great. Also if you're into great literature but are scared about it this is the class to take.
Faulkner is difficult and I didn't really have any idea what I was getting myself into. That said, I learned a lot and Prof. Stern is really really smart and cool. I would def recommend taking this class down the road in your English career, after you've taken quite a few classes and are really comfortable with discussion because I found this classroom particularly intimidating.
I would have loved less discussion and more lecture-style teaching. Everything Prof. Stern had to say was great, and I would have liked to hear more of it.
Lots of reading, but a really good class for English majors and minors. Prof. Stern is stern but great
This course will definitely challenge you in so many ways. Faulkner feels almost impossible at times. But you learn so much from being thrown into his crazy world! Professor Stern is so passionate and she’s great at helping you work through tough topics. A course that everyone will grow from!
I took this class because I love Julia Stern, not because I had any interest in Faulkner. Honestly, Faulkner didn't grow on me much, but Professor Stern is so witty and intelligent that it made up for it. Honestly Professor Stern is one of my favorite English professors at Northwestern: she gets everyone involved in discussion, made me feel like what I was saying in class was insightful instead of stupid, and even had an end-of-the-year party at her house during our last class. It's worth taking the class just for her. Our TA Brad was also wonderful, since he was good at rephrasing some of the loftier concepts that we learned into something a little more understandable. They worked very well together and made the class a lot of fun, even if the reading material wasn't my favorite.
Professor Stern's Faulkner class is an absolute Northwestern bucket list class!!!! Any English major (or person interested in reading fascinating and challenging novels) should do their very best to find time to take this class. Professor Stern is a brilliant teacher, with strong opinions on everything she teaches but also an openness and enthusiasm that encourages every student to create their own theories and ideas about these dense and amazing novels. A thing I really love about this class is that it prioritizes careful close-reading over anything else - there is very little work throughout the quarter other than reading and re-reading the novels, which allows you time to actually finish and think about all of the books. Highest praise!
