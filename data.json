                "The teacher did a good job of teaching the information from the book. My main issue from the class was that the textbook just didn't feel completely appropriate for the subject of the course. With the current textbook and teaching style, this felt like a good freshman-level course. However, as an upperclassman, it felt a little bit easy\u2fbasic.",
                "Lecture notes were not going to be put up on canvas SO I went to basically every single lecture. They are extremely boring lectures, and you will find yourself writing down and being told the same equation over 50 times. Lectures are based exactly off of the book, but lecture does not do anything to supplement the book material. Furthermore, reading the book is more interesting\u02fengaging/understandable than lectures. You do not really learn anything new until the last two weeks of the class.",
                "Class was okay. Homework was hard - needed assistance from TA's during discussion almost every week to do it. Lecture went at a good pace. Lots of repetition to lock in concepts",
                "It was the instructors first time presenting this course so it wasn't perfect, but it was pretty well organized. Too many notes to take down made it hard to understand lecture.",
                "I enjoyed this course more than I thought I ever would and think it will prove to be very helpful in engineering applications",
                "There are a lot of parts of lecture that can be improved to help students in general. For example, the amount of writing that is expected during class makes it unable for a lot of students to comprehend what they are reading.",
                "This course was very interesting but the material was very hard. It is important to keep up with day to day lectures and lessons and make sure you understand them; otherwise, you will fall behind and will perform poorly on exams.The problem sets are meant to be very challenging but if you try to get through them yourself and give yourself enough time throughout the week to do it - and not procrastinate - it will be very much worth it in the end.",
                "Professor Kamat is a great teacher. She cares about her students and makes the class entertaining and informative.",
                "Good class, not too challenging. Final was pretty difficult though, would recommend studying well in advance for it.",
                "Professor Kamat is very kind and relatable. Do the homework, and you will be fine. Go to the discussion section for help on the homework. The TAs are very chill and helpful. For exams, you have to effectively pace yourself, because you can be very pressed for time.",
                "It was a very fair course where the homeworks were pretty hard but the test were extremely fair. Kamat was a great teacher and gave very useful notes during class. You had to go to class or else you wouldn't get good notes. The book is kinda hard to read so going to class is preferred. There is also a 2 hour discussion section where the TAs hang out to answer questions. This was super nice because I would just do my weekly homework there.",
                "This course started off really easy, but escalated in complexity throughout the quarter. This class improved my problem-solving skills.",
                "You have to write a lot as there are no lecture slides available, the homework wasn't easy and took a lot of time, the exams were not that bad and you get a cheat sheet",
                "At first, I thought this class was difficult and boring. It got much more interesting as the quarter went by and the problems became sort of fun to solve. I definitely recommend putting full effort into the problem sets. They are much more difficult than exams, so if you learn through the problem sets, you'll be set for the exams.",
                "It was definitely hard (esp. homeworks) but reasonable",
                "This class is not bad, homework assignments take a while but are not challenging. Second half of the course picks up speed.",
                "Pretty low-paced and boring class. Homework took a lot of time to finish. Discussion session was very helpful for homework questions. Lecture notes are not posted, so you have to go to class",
                "Homeworks took literally forever but the prof is so sweet I can't even be mad about it. Tbh not sure how much thermo is actually being taught? Seems like the class is structured really differently than it has been in the past. But all in all a pretty reasonable class.",
                "The material and first midterm started off ridiculously easy, but then got way harder for the second midterm. Kamat writes really fast so it's sometime hard to keep up",
                "Weekly homework is time consuming but the material is pretty straightforward. Tests are harder than they should be but manageable",
                "This course overall was a good course. The homework took a really long time, but the discussion section was VERY VERY helpful. The midterms were reasonable; midterm one was VERY easy but midterm two was decently hard. The final was extremely hard, however. The professor is very approachable and teaches the material very well, but the final exam was definitely on a whole new level of difficulty.",
                "I think the material was outlined very well in class. I thought the teacher adjusted well to the class to improve the learning experience.",
                "Great course, great lectures, and amazing TA's! Difficult, but if you take time on the HW, studying for the test is much easier.",
                "Great professor, homework took a long time, but exams were reasonable.",
                "This class is great! Professor Kamat is a great lecturer and has really fair tests. The homeworks are time consuming, but the exams are definitely doable!",
                "Not that hard for a core BME class. Just stay on top of the work. Midterms were not unexpected, homeworks prepare you for them.",
                "Prof. Kamat ROCKS and actually makes this subject interesting. Everything is super clear and she's always checking in to make sure students understand.",
                "SET ASIDE A LOT OF TIME FOR PROBLEM SETS. The TAs guide you a little bit in discussion sections, but you're not going to learn how to setup a problem by following what the TAs say to do.",
                "I really enjoyed taking this course. I think it was particularly interesting because the course of BME specific with BME applications. I generally had a lot of fun from the lectures to even solving the problems.",
                "Really easy but it did not seem much like thermo. Seemed to be an intro to bioengineering class not a intro to thermo class. Professor was great though and really seemed to care about the students and wanted us to learn and do well in the course. A good teacher",
                "I was really nervous about thermodynamics prior to this course. Professor Kamat is extremely approachable and made the course material very manageable.",
                "I really loved this class!!! The professor was amazing and really invested in making sure everyone understood the material! She's definitely better when she's prepared (gets a little frazzled when asked about things she wasn't prepared for), but overall she was wonderful. Second exam definitely way harder than the first, but the final was relatively fair, so (I think) it works out okay. Also, make sure to start the hw early - it's definitely VERY time consuming! Still would recommend taking this class with her though!",
                "This professor (Kamat) is young, new, and sweet, but her teaching methods are boring. Basically, just jam all the formulas onto your cheat sheet for the midterms and you'll be fine. However, the weekly problem sets take FOREVER, like 8 hours. Not a great class, but you'll get a good grade if you put in the hours.",
                "Great course! This is the first BME major course that actually felt applicable to future careers. If you get Professor Kamat, she is amazing and you will love her!",
                "Prof. Nekat is so nice and makes everything really easy for you to understand. Slower pace than most NU classes which was so nice"

                "I thought that the notes for the class were clear and that studying for tests wasn't hard.",
                "Studying for exams is very difficult because there are no practice exams and no solutions to the textbook problems are provided. You can only really study from old homework problems. The content isn't too difficult; most of the content were ideas I have already learned. Homeworks still take a long time though.",
                "Easy to understand first few weeks but accounting equations need to be fully understood to get through this class. Rely on TAs for hw and exams",
                "dont take this class if you dont have to homework is long and makes no sense because youre given no instruction and class notes are hard to follow because there's so much inconsistency in what she writes",
                "Good class, if you do the homework and go to office hours you should do well. Kamat is super nice, she gets a little confused on some concepts here and there in lecture but overall a pretty good lecturer. She doesn't give enough practice material outside of homework - but her exams are very fair.",
                "Professor Kamat is really great for a new professor. Her class is very fair. The first third of the class was taught really well, the second two thirds of the course got more confusing as the professor would sometimes make mistakes in lecture that made my own notes hard to follow since she didn't post any notes online. Overall, a good class. Thermodynamics sounds scary, but this class is not.",
                "I like.",
                "People always seem to say that thermo classes are really difficult, but I really enjoyed this class. It relies a lot on problem solving and logic; sometimes, the homework can be a bit difficult, but the examples from class help out a lot.",
                "This class is pretty easy. Its mostly just problem solving, but it is useful, and I learned a fair amount. Theres one pset a week that can take up to 8-10 hours on a bad week, but do those well and youll have no problems on the tests.",
                "I was surprised by the homework. Much more difficult than I expected. But if you put the effort into it, it prepared you for the tests very well.",
                "This class covered relationships that were important to know, but the first half of the class didn't feel like there was much content covered, just organization of answers on a page. The second half was much better when we got to energy and fluids. Homework also got more applicable as the course went on- in the beginning, most of the time I spent on problem sets was dedicated to the organization of the answer page.",
                "I was really disappointed in this class. We spent the first 7 weeks learning how to solve glorified systems of equations applied to BME topics. Prof. Kamat is a clear and nice instructor, but I think the course material and homework are so useless. I don't feel like I know more about the world now, just how to deal with tedious equations.",
                "Thermo is a difficult class, and I recommend you utilize the office hours as much as possible. As far as I know, there are only three per week, two of which come in the form of a discussion section, which severely limits your options. Otherwise, you'll be left doing the homework, which has to be the most difficult weekly assignment I've seen while I've been here. Fortunately, the tests are more or less pared-down versions of the homework, which means if you understand the work you'll do fine when it counts. Still, there's going to be a lot of frustrating trial-and-error that you're going to have to prepare for in order to get through most of the class.",
                "Prof. Kamat is great but the course itself is very disappointing. I didn't learn many new things. The course itself is so surface level, and we spend so much time on easy algebra in the earlier part of the course. It is very disappointing that the BME department makes us take such a surface level course for an important subject. Not a good use of time at all.",
                "This is a good class, and its taught really well. It will cover all the basics of thermodynamics from the perspective of Bioengineering. I'm not BME, I'm an environmental engineer, so I was a bit concerned that it would be too focused on human bio processes, and the class itself was not. On the other hand, the textbook problems were, and were also way too long. The homeworks were ridiculously long, often tedious. I blame this on the textbook, which offers long-format problems that just take forever to internalize. That's the worst part of this class. The tests are very fair, but watch out for time constraints. Overall this was a good course, and Professor Kamat was fantastic.",
                "This class was useful, although the text seemed to cover the material in a round-about way much of the time.",
                "The course in general isn't too bad. The weekly homeworks took a lot of time, and was really difficult. The midterms and final were all easier than the hw and tested you on if you actually knew the material, not meant to trick you. As a result, the exams are all pretty fair, but that being said, if you make a mistake on an exam, it is very hard to bounce back since the averages are all very high. Kamat is a good lecturer, but the lectures sometimes felt redundant and unorganized. It's also annoying how the course notes are not posted online so you can not go back and review notes if you do not write them down quickly during the lecture",
                "Pretty good course, homeworks will take you a very long time so try to start them early. Really commit a lot of time to them, they help you study for the exams. Exams are very fair, no real suprises but make sure to know how to do all aspects of the homework. Lecture was rather repetitive and quick (felt as if I was just endlessly copying notes down), was a little ineffective at teaching concepts, often was easier and quicker to just read the book (good textbook).",
                "Overall the course is difficult, but this is mostly due to incredibly high expectations from the professor. Homework is very difficult and it\u2019s not actually graded for completion so make sure you know her grading policies beforehand. The midterms aren\u2019t difficult content-wise but you will run out of time if you haven\u2019t done a million practice problems. Strict professor, but is easier if you do everything.",
                "The professor is very nice and wants students to do well. Homeworks were helpful but longer than necessary. Homework grading was nice that it was only 2. Class expectations or instructions were not always clear, expecially with specific homework problems. Note taking in class made learning difficult.",
                "Lecture does not really help, most of it comes from the textbook. First exam is outrageously easy as compared to the midterm. Professor just copied down notes from one piece of paper to another, and then made mistakes doing so. Also, often didn't have great answers for questions. A lot of the lectures have errors in them, missing negative signs in equations etc. Example problems given in class are hard to follow and not very useful because professor just pulled out numbers and didn't say what question from the book the example was. Also, professor says that 2 homework problems are graded for accuracy while the others are graded for completion, but this isn't the case, they grade them all for accuracy which is wrong. Professor Kamat was really bad at responding to emails in which students asked questions. Also, apparently when asked about how she graded the homework versus what the syllabus said, she responded by saying they reserve the right to grade for completion, so basically when they are lazy or don't feel like grading they can make it for completion. Really fake professor, seems nice and all but isn't very helpful.",
                "",
                "",
                "Overall, bad course, worse homework assignments, 2nd midterm and final are really hard, read the textbook to get equations and examples, honestly barely have to go to class since she just writes down stuff straight from the textbook and does a worse job explaining it.",
                "Great course, would recommend.",
                "This was a solid course and was more interesting than I expected. Professor Kamat was a good teacher. Tests were graded pretty harshly tho.",
                "This class was okay. The weekly homework was pretty long and tedious, however going to TA office hours is pretty helpful for doing the homework. Kamat made it clear what we needed to know, however she makes so many mistakes in lecture that you won't really understand your notes when you look back at them. Additionally, it was really weird and super annoying that she wouldn't give back our tests to us, instead we had to go look at them in her office during select times but we weren't allowed to take them out of her office. Additionally, the way the homework is graded is so stupid. On the syllabus it said that they will only grade two problems for correctness and the rest for completion, however this was basically a complete lie as a lot of students got points off for the completion problems that they had done incorrectly. Also, Kamat's office hours are Friday at 3 pm which is such a bad time because no one has started the homework by then and a lot of people have class at 3, and then the TA office hours are Friday at 3 and Monday at 2, which are also very inconvenient times.",
                "I liked the professor and her teaching style because it was very organized and direct. Her tests were not impossible, although it was a time crunch.",
                "This class is affectively a filler course for the university. There is nothing novel to the class that is learned here. It draws on the conservation of momentum and force learned in EA2, fluid dynamics via the bernouli equation which I assume we will learn in fluid dynamics the class and conservation of charge covered in Physics 135-2. It would be nice to have one more elective instead of thermodynamics which only deals with heat during weeks 6-9. Stay on top of work and it will be fine.",
                "Overall this course is not too bad. During class you get all of your notes and you must apply during the homeworks. The homeworks take time depending on the week. The problems are harder than tests and exams and they count for a good portion of your grade. It is important to understand these well because although easier, the tests are a time crunch and you have to understand the material well enough to do it fast and right the first time around. However, overall, the material is not hard to understand and apply.",
                "The course is more on the theory side so the problem sets are not too difficult. Prof. Kamat is a really nice professoe who does a great job in explaining everything in detail",
                "The homework is lengthy, make sue you start with time, work with other students, and attend discussion.",
                "Homework takes a while, so be sure to get started early. Exams are a bit of a time-crunch. Prof. Kamat doesn't post notes online, so you have to go to class (or get notes from someone else).",
                "This course was not especially intellectually challenging, but it does require some good problem-solving skills. The weekly homework assignments prevent you from falling behind in the class which is good.",
                "Attend class because the professor doesn't post the notes online. The class also focused a lot on memorizing the equations and plugging numbers into equations. Some of the homework problems were very tedious because there were lots of variables and calculations.",
                "The course was okay. A lot of what we learned in each class was retaught the next class, so the content often felt very dragged out and unnecessary.",
                "This class was very poorly structured because aside from the problem sets, which were extremely long and beyond what we went over in class (one time taking me almost 20 hours to complete), there was no other additional practice to review for exams and go over course material, which is the main way I am able to study and feel prepared. Hopefully in the future students will have more access to extra practice problems made by the professor or solutions to book problems.",
                "Exams were long but generally fair, homework was decently time consuming but helpful, Professor Kamat is good teacher and she teaches in a very light-hearted manner which I appreciated",
                "Dr. Kamat was always very relatable and easy to learn from. However, sometimes the homework took way too long. They aren't typically difficult problems; but with the engineering methodology that we have to follow (which I do like, since it makes sense in terms of the progression of the problem), the problems often take extended periods of time to complete. Also, I often found myself making up methods to solving problems, since they were often different from problems we look at in class, so it was often frustrating to not know what I was doing until I compared my answers to the key after the homework was due. This is especially important because the homework problems are more similar to what is on the exams in comparison to the problems done in class.",
                "Professor Kamat really cares about her students and does a good job of making the material easy to understand. Course starts off very easy but ramps up later. The problem sets are very long and difficult (so start them early and go to discussion) but the tests are very manageable.",
                "The course was interesting and well taught but the homeworks took upwards of 6-8 hours some weeks. The TAs are good about answering questions in discussion though, which was useful. The first and second midterm were not too difficult but I felt really pressed for time, while the final was better paced but a lot harder.",

                "This is one of my favorite courses I have taken at Northwestern. I thought the lectures were both interesting and helpful and I was particularly interested in the material because I think it is extremely applicable to real-life engineering.",
                "Very reasonable class. Many applicable concepts and Alarcon is an amazing teacher who is very passionate and cares about her students. The more examples problems you do the more you will get out of the class. If you put in the effort she will do her best to help you succeed.",
                "Arancha is a fantastic professor. Only take this class with her. I struggled in EA2, so I thought I was going to struggle in this class - that was not the case! She helped clarify everything and truly cares about her students success. She gives you all the tools to do well, you just have to use them.",
                "The instruction for the course was extremely helpful, every class lecture, video posted, and FAQs all helped lead to a better understanding of what was happening. At times the homework were extremely time confusing but always assigned far in advance.",
                "If you have the chance to take CivE216 with Professor Alarcon, please do. She is absolutely one of the kindest and most capable professors I've ever had. She takes the time to get to know each student's name, goes out of her way to explain concepts in multiple ways so that students who learn differently can succeed equally well, and is just a really talented, effective teacher. Her passion for the topic makes it much more interesting to learn as well. The midterms were challenging but overall, fair. Make sure to do extra problems and to take advantage of office hours. Overall, this class was a great experience, especially due to Professor Alarcon.",
                "Prpfessor Alarcon was absolutely fantastic and provided so any different ways to learn the material, whether posting her own written, thurough hw solutions online, her remarkable videos, or just houng over the problems in class through multiple different ways.",
                "Arancha is the best!!!! Take it with Alarcon she actually cares about her students and makes an effort to get to know them! Go to her office hours she's amazing!!!",
                "This class is very interesting and necessary towards BME. The homeworks were great practice and lectures were very thorough.",
                "The professor was very approachable, clear, organized, and extremely helpful. I found the material interesting and very applicable to my major. The class style was great as we did lots of practice problems in class but also went over concepts even when online lectures were posted regarding those topics. The pace of the course was very manageable but I still felt that I learned a lot.",
                "I loved Dr. Alarcon's way of teaching and learned alot in this class. While the material may seem unimportant with how computers are used to run all of the calculations, Knowing how the equations work is super useful. I suggest anyone who is an MechE to take this class especially with Dr. Alarcon. If I could I would take this class again.",
                "It is a required course for my major, which means it helps me to advance my skill. So in that sense it is necessary to master relevant problem solving skills",
                "This course was critical to developing an approach to structural loading and failure analysis that I was using directly in Mech 240 during the same quarter. We moved quickly enough that I didn't struggle at all to apply what I was learning directly to my other subject and I actually believe it helped me reinforce the material by taking both simultaneously.",
                "Very good teacher, material is tough but definitely doable. Online resources provided by professor are great. Take it with her.",
                "I really thought Ms. Alarcon was a motivating, friendly and helpful teacher. She gladly anwered any questions in class and encouraged everybody to speak their mind to further understand what was being taught in class. Most importantly, her enthusiasm for her field of work could not go unnoticed. The class was pretty forward. If you get a hang of the logic this course will be easy yet insightful.",
                "Alarcon is a pretty good teacher and cares a lot. She gives you all the tools to do well so just check Canvas and go to her office hours. I\u027d say go to class for her thorough explanations especially for new topics. We learn a lot of material in this course but overall it's not too demanding.",
                "Very good class that is taught very well. Even if you only have a passing interest in the field, it is a very good class to take for basic engineering requirements. One thing to note is that the exams tend to be very rushed.",
                "This class is as advertised. The first half of the quarter is easy, and then the difficulty picks up pretty quickly into the end of the quarter. The midterms are pretty long, so you have to work fast if you want to finish.",
                "Prof. Alarcon is really passionate and inspiring. I am not a CivE (IEMS) and I adimt that I felt constantly excited about learning the material even thought it has nothing to do with my major. Prof. Alarcon, is very attentive and tries a variety of different approaches to have students learn the material. She would have students come to the board and try practice problems, was readily available for OH, and NEVER disregarded a question --she was always excited to clear any doubts.",
                "Prof. Alarcon is a great lecturer - she explains concepts very well, comes up with a vast amount of resources to help students with understand both the knowledge of the subject and knowledge of completing exams/homework, and cares for her students.",
                "This class would be awful without Alarcon. I hated EA2 and thought it was a real pain. But Alarcon made this class super easy and even relatively interesting. Definitely would take again. I don't recommend the BME section though.",
                "This is a wonderful class. I know it is a requirement for many, but let yourself enjoy it. The homework and the exams are incredibly fair. If you go to class and listen and work through the problems with Professor Alarcon, you will do well. The class is organized and she equips you with everything you need to succeed and learn a lot. One of the first classes where you feel that what you're learning is applicable to the real world. Love this class.",
                "Great class and not too difficult. Great teaching style and tools",
                "Alarcon is a good lecturer. Not a hard class if you go to lecture. I was able to complete the homework very quickly each week but it was a little annoying to have to use the yellow engineering paper. Labs are easy, but the write up can take a few hours as a group.",
                "Professor Alarcon is organized and gives many resources including videos, solutions, and supplemental information. She has a good teaching style, is always excited about the class, and genuinely wants every student to do well.",
                "Interesting to learn a little more about architecture and civil engineering in general, though I can't imagine myself doing it as a career",
                "Take it with Alacron. Enough said.",
                "I can't imagine taking this class with anyone other than Alarcon. She makes it so easy to do well, and if you follow her advice and do the problems when you should, you'll do well in this class.",
                "Alarcon is an especially dedicated and helpful professor. She really wants you to learn. It's a lot of work, but if you put in the time you can keep up. Do practice problems and you'll probably be fine.",
                "V good idea to take this course with Alarcon. She explains topics very clearly and tells you exactly what you need to know. Exams are pretty straightforward and are similar to the practice exams.",
                "The curriculum is very straight forward and easy to follow.",
                "This course covers material that is integral to basic engineering, especially skills that will be the foundation for other classes.",
                "Alacron is very systematic which can be a drag sometimes, but follow her process and you will do well.",
                "Class was exactly as a expected to be.",
                "Not a big fan of the material but the professor was very helpful and put so many resources out there for you to learn",
                "This course was good. The labs were not that difficult and the homework was a good representation of the exams.",
                "Teacher was really helpful.",
                "Great course. Very interesting. Not a lot of required busy work like in a lot of classes, so you really get what you put into the course.",
                "I think this class is a perfect follow-up to EA2. Having taken the two sequentially made for a very natural transition. Of course, the topics are more advanced than those of EA2, but it never felt overwhelming. Overall, I enjoyed learning about mechanics of materials much more than I would have expected.",
                "This course emphasized large number crunching methods that was good practice for engineering but proved to be difficult to understand and impossible to apply in my other classes.",
                "Take this class with Alarcon -- she's the best. Do the practice and homework at least mostly by yourself and it shouldn't be too hard of a class.",
                "I actually had fun with the material in this course and enjoyed solving the problems. I remember struggling with the subject in the engineering analysis course and finding it rather boring but Professor Alarcon was so passionate about the topic that it was hard not to be interested in it with her. She made the lectures very clear and organized, which I really appreciated. She clearly cares about her students and go way beyond her way to help each and every student that she can in any way.",
                "Professor Alarcon is an amazing professor who truly cares about her students and is passionate about what she teaches. She's incredibly talented at teaching and makes this course a breeze.",
                "The lecture was extremely helpful because we went through examples in class. The professor took time to explain and also had examples to help enforce the concepts we learned.",
                "Good class. Great teacher. Very helpful, especially if you ask for it. Exams kind of long, not unfair though. Overall ok.",
                "I love how much passion Prof Alarcon puts into this class and her students. I can tell that she really cares sincerely about both the material and our learning. I think she is a great professor and I appreciate her teaching style, organization, and jokes.",
                "This is a course with somewhat challenging criteria but a great professor. If you go to class and be present and attentive, you should do well in the course. Make sure that you do as many practice problems as you can, as they are a very good representation of what will be on the exams.",
                "It was fine, not incredibly interesting but probably helpful when we begin designing structures.",
                "Alarcon is an amazing teacher who actually cares about how her students are learning. If you're going to take this course, try to take it with her! Also, this class is all about the amount of work you put in. It's not hard to do well if you just spend time practicing all the problem.",
                "I really enjoyed Professor Alarcon's method of teaching. You could really tell that she cared about her students. I never went into office hours, but I'm sure she would be very helpful. If you don't understand a method she's teaching, I think it's easy to ask her for another way to think about it. I didn't really like the separate class for BME students. I wish it was integrated into our daily lectures. I don't think non-BME students would be upset if Profesor Alarcon used a bone structure to show an example. I think it would make the lectures more interesting.",
                "This course was easy for those looking for a distribution requirement. The homework and labs are straightforward, and the midterms aren't bad either.",
                "Flexible grading schema makes it so no one has to drop the class after a midterm or a bad assignment. Grading schema can include using your final as 70% of your grade. BEWARE THOUGH- the final is hard!!",
                "Alarcon is good if you care about the class. Come to class for extra credit. Midterms are decent, final TBD.",
                "Alarcon is very passionate, which makes her a good professor... But i thought the midterms were absurdly long and not always the most consistent with the material we learned",
                "The course was helpful in applying equilibrium physics to deformations.",
                "Being an IE major first thought I would really dislike this class. It turns out I sort of liked it. It was really nice to take a freshman/sophomore when knowing others in the class. If one is IE major it sort of what you make of it: if you try to like it and work hard then the class isn't bad. Alarcon was the best and really helpful. I wouldn't want to take it with anyone else. Go to lecture! It is 100% a toss up to do the lab or the BME section. The BME lecture and the labs are the worst part of the class.",
                "UNDERSTAND BASICS ABOUT MATERIALS REACTION TO LOADING",
                "This was one of my best experiences in a McCormick classroom. The professor made a real effort to understand the needs of the students and tailor lectures to those needs. She laid out the course in an extremely organized fashion and stuck to the schedule. The problem sets were reasonable and assisted the learning process.",
                "It's a good class, and Prof. Alarcon really does care about students. It's not a bad choice to take after EA2, since a lot of the concepts build on statics."

                "This class stimulated interest in the area because of how it incorporated real world problems. It made you want to learn what was happening to better prepare yourself for future problems.",
                "This is a tough course, but well structured. If you listen to her advice, do the problems in the book, actually do the homework, you will succeed. Similar to math courses, if you put in the work you will succeed, but will miserably fail if you half ass it.",
                "I really enjoyed this course! I think the material that was covered is very applicable to real life, and Alarcon does well in relating what we are learning to real life examples. I think that her tests are very fair, and you know exactly what she will cover. So as long as you do practice problems before exams and review your notes, you are bound to do well. She is very picky about her homework, so make sure to follow the guidelines exactly before submitting them. Overall I really enjoyed the course and would recommend it for anybody needing a basic engineering course.",
                "Professor Alarcon is the best! She really cares about her students and gives you every opportunity to succeed in the class, including lots of extra credit. Go to class and office hours and you should be just fine. The BME discussion is far worse; I don't feel like I learned anything from that part of the class, but the amount of work isn't excessive so that should be fine too.",
                "Prof.Alarcon is a great teacher. Kind, helpful and it is obvious that she thought about the course and cares deeply about it. I would recommend taking this course.",
                "I mostly enjoyed the material, and found that the problems still required a lot of thinking and problem solving even though the class centers around only a few formulas.",
                "Pretty good class. Homework\u2019s can be long and labs seem kind of pointless, but the problems are somewhat interesting and Prof Alarcon is really great.",
                "Had to take this as a distro for basic engineering. I should have taken it earlier (a quarter or two after taking EA2). Had to play a little catch-up, but not a bad course. Grading system wants you to do well, as does the Professor. Problem sets are time consuming, not that helpful for learning the material in my opinion.",
                "Alarcon was an incredible lecturer and really cares for her students. She has a lot of resources to help students learn and reading the textbook is helpful as well. The midterms + final are organized well and are not too bad. There is also a lenient grading system so that you can have your final count for most of your grade if you mess up on a midterm. The BME discussion section for this class was organized pretty poorly however. I feel like the BME section is pretty useless in addition and seems like it only brings down your grade if anything. Some topics in the discussion are interesting, but do not match up well with what we are learning in lecture and are not in depth enough to actually learn anything substantive.",
                "do the hw and youll be fine",
                "The course is taught very well and if you listen in class, you will do well. As far as actual content, however, it is very civil-focused, and so seems not very applicable from a BME standpoint.",
                "Really enjoyed this class, Professor Alarcon is amazing and very very helpful. Make sure to go to lecture and sitting up front helps with focusing since it\u2019s quite a large class.",
                "Arancha is a great teacher, she really cares that her students do well and if you go to class you will learn and she will tell you exactly what is on exams which are very fair. The material itself is difficult so expect to put in some time studying and doing the homework. However, the labs are a useless but easy one hour.",
                "I was able to learn more about the material and challenge myself on the material",
                "I thought this course was really well taught. It was definitely challenging but nothing that was too difficult.",
                "This class builds on EA-2, and I would recommend it highly for Basic Engineering. Alarcon posts a lot of opportunities for practice problems, videos and practice exams. She wants her students to do well and really cares. She is far and away the best professor in McCormick. Show up to class and take notes, do the practice exams, sit in the front of class and this class will be very manageable. I wish I could take a class with her every quarter!",
                "The course was very organized which was nice. I always knew what we were doing, why, and how it related to the other material in the course. As a Civil Engineering major it also felt directly related to my future work. Professor Alarcon is great - she's a good teacher and genuinely cares about whether you learn the material. The material is definitely challenging and you need to spend a long time doing homeworks and studying, but if you put in the time it's not too hard to actually learn the material.",
                "I taught myself most the material for this class. I attended every lecture but didn't really get a ton out of them as things were not explained well. The only lectures that were worth while were the ones that were the day before the test. She did a really good job of reviewing all the material. Tests were fair and not too difficult, similar to homeworks but easier. Homeworks were decently long but helped with tests. All in all it was an average class.",
                "Prof. Alarcon-Flemming is a wonderful professor who gives her all to make sure you understand what's going on. Only drawback I personally saw was that she tends to diatance herself from being accesible by providing a sht ton of supplementary examples and documents. If you're like me and have a busy schedule and dont necessarily have. The time to come through several quarters worth of information for clarifications, I strongly recommend prioritizing her and the TA office hours!",
                "This course was similar to EA2. I enjoyed the way that it was taught and that there were so many resources that could be accessed if you are ever confused. If you can take this course with professor Alarcon you should she is amazing.",
                "The civil engineering part of the class was quite fair and the professor provided a lot of material to study from. Perhaps the lecture notes could be a bit clearer to follow, but otherwise it was fair. The BME part of the class was a bit lacking, but I still learned some interesting things from it.",
                "This course was fairly easy especially because Alarcon is a good teacher. Doing all of the homeworks and practice midterms was normally enough to do very well. concepts are not too difficult overall, it's more about being able to do things quickly on the tests. The labs are absolutely pointless, you spend about an hour just breaking or bending or twisting samples and then write the lab report. An easy boost for your grade but I felt like I got nothing out of them personally.",
                "This course is good because you can keep up with the work, it's well organized, and the professor really wants you to learn.",
                "Alarcon is a great professor. She explains things very clearly and it's fairly easy to do well in the class. The weekly homeworks are pretty time consuming but doable. The exams are very fair. It is so worth it to look at the solutions for all old exams posted on Canvas. I really enjoyed the fun fact Fridays.",
                "feel like it could use restructuring, more relevant problems, less focus on doing things only one way and more openness to different approaches.",
                "Excellent course, but challenging. You have to work at it.",
                "It was a good course to supplement other courses that I'm taking. Some of the material can be a little dry but with the right professor you learn a lot .",
                "The instructor really tried to make it interesting for everybody.",
                "It's not too bad, labs are dumb but easy. Do your HW, you'll be fine.",
                "I loved this class! Absolutely take it with Professor Alarcon because she is so passionate about civ e and knows so much! She is super accommodating and willing to help. Also, she takes the time to get to know her students which is refreshing when most engineering professors are just there to teach the material. This course is challenging but if you put in the time and do all the practice problems, an A is obtainable.",
                "This course was great! I'm maybe biased as this is the material that I want to work with for the rest of my life, but Professor Alarcon is genuinely incredible. She teaches the material so thoroughly and energetically. Going to class is definitely key and will make prepping for exams infinitely better. Honestly, she teaches so well that I found myself leaving class with an excellent grasp on the material and simply needed to do practice problems before each exam to increase my speed and full understanding. I would definitely recommend this class and definitely take it with Professor Alarcon.",
                "Prof. Alarcon was a very good lecturer, and made herself endlessly available for any sort of extra help. We did a lot of review (almost every day), which did get a little old but it probably helped a lot. Homeworks are excellent tools to learn the concepts, and without them I wouldn't have done near as well in the course.",
                "This class was really enjoyable. It taught material in a way that introduces why structures around you are built the way they are.",
                "The course was thorough and it contained a lot of information relating to civil engineering.",
                "If you're taking this course it is probably because you have to. It's applications can actually be interesting and Prof. Alarcon is fantastic. The labs are pretty dumb and not that helpful, but manageable.",
                "I think that this course was extremely well taught by Professor Alarcon. The material covered is extremely applicable to engineering in general, and she makes sure to give plenty of real life applications as well as plenty of sample problems so that students are able to master keu concepts.",
                "Learned most of the material on my own doing the homework.",
                "I found this class relatively interesting going in and I liked the course as a whole. I found it very important to follow along in class and go to office hours and look at the extra examples given on canvas. Tests were fair, homework took some time every week, and doing practice problems was the most helpful in the class.",
                "This course was intellectually challenging, but also interesting. I think it is beneficial to have a background in general physics, like EA2, but that it's not imperative.",
                "I really enjoyed the fact that the professor took time to make videos breaking down the important concepts of the course.",
                "It was really helpful.",
                "As the course progressed, and study habits declined in quality. This course did an exceptional job of making relevant study material EASILY and QUICKLY available as well as thorough and pleasant to follow.",
                "Honestly, I was really dreading this class, but Professor Alarcon made this class pretty enjoyable. If you put in the time to studying and understanding the concepts it's not that bad. There were a few concepts that went way over my head the first few days, but once I sat down to learn them they weren't bad. The class is structured for you to succeed (there are different ways for your grade to be calculated, a bunch of grades that impact your overall grade, and tons of bonus points), so if you try you can do well.",
                "Being a senior in industrial engineering (and given that this was my senior spring quarter), I literally had zero interest in the materials taught in this course. My previous experiences with other basic engineering courses were 'okay' at best as I found them to be boring. But this one was different. The level of energy and passion that Professor Alarcon brings to this course is pretty amazing. She also makes the experience of going to class more enjoyable by occasionally providing us with the real-world examples of civil engineering applications. You can just tell from the way she treats her students that she genuinely wants you to succeed in this class; she is always willing to help so don't be afraid to reach out to her. The labs are not very difficult as they actually relate back to the materials learned during the lectures. There are also plenty of resources on Canvas available for you to do well on the exams. I seriously would have considered a different major (e.g. Civ E or BME, etc) if I had taken this class earlier in my Northwestern career.",
                "I was hoping to apply my knowledge from ea2 to this course and learn about civ e in the real world but did not end up learning much. Class was hard to follow and so boring (not because of Alarcon, but because it has nothing to do with my future work/what I'm studying) so I therefore did not enjoy the class. Not nearly as easy as I thought it would be",
                "Super helpful for Mech E. Doing as many practice problems as possible really helps.",
                "I very much enjoyed this class. I felt that the combination of labs, classes, and quizzes that tested our knowledge of the core principles of the class gave me a deeper understanding of Civil Engineering.",
                "If you are going to take this course, definitely take it with Alarcon. She is incredibly nice and extremely fair. She posts all of her solutions to everything, so you can see how she does problems. Many exam questions are taken straight from previous exams, so it's possible to do very well on tests. The hws are not too bad",
                "Alarcon is amazing!!! She really cares about each and every one of her students doing well in her class and gives the class more than enough materials to succeed. She doesn't hesitate to go back and explain a confusing concept again but also holds her class to high standards and expects you to put in work outside of class. She knows the material extremely well and explains it clearly and concisely.",
                "The 4 days a week part that is taught by Alarcon is fantastic, she is great and you will do fine if you just go to class. The once a week BME 271 part taught by Gloria Kim needs to be updated. We had quizzes over things that were sometimes taught later in the class that we did not know, or were just quizzes over things we would never need to know\u02fdid not apply. Kim also doesnt really lecture so much as just read slides to you so fast you dont really pick up anything. Very strange and I hope that this part of the class is changed.",
                "It was hard the first time and it is still hard the second time but I think I'm going to pass this time. So that's nice",
                "a bit daunting and overwhelmed with content",
                "Prof. Alarcon is great. The homework can be tough, but it's a great way to learn. The BME recitation started out kinda boring, but once Prof. Kim took our suggestions into consideration, they got better.",
                "I loved this class. I am terrible about teaching myself from a textbook but did not need to use it one bit as prof Alarcon's lectures are crystal clear and her exams are fair. I considered taking more CIVE classes because of this class.",
                "Great class with a really fast pace and lots of problem-solving.",
                "Great course, this is how engineering courses should be structured. Chapters are formatted very nicely so that each is related and built on previously learned concepts. Professor Alarcon is great, you can really see her passion through her teaching. She provides so many resources and practice problems on Canvas that makes it straightforward and easy to review for tests.",
                "Classes and the playlists are extremely useful- take the time to be there and pay attention, and it will pay off well on the homeworks and quizzes.",
                "I love how Prof Alacron is so patient and so willing to help us learn!! She is an excellent teacher!",
                "Really not too bad. Important that you stay on top of everything. Easy to follow but since it meets everyday, we covered a lot of topics and playing catchup was no fun. Homework wasn't too bad. Make sure you follow her exact formatting or she will give you a zero."

                "The material isn't difficult, but digital signal processing is much more of a maths topic than an engineering one or even a modeling one, so at times it felt like what I was expecting of the course and what the course was aiming to be were at odds with the material we were actually supposed to be covering. The lectures really need to be more in the format of a maths lecture, and if possible, reformated with a strong sense for what needs to be emphasized for students to understand the mathematical mechanism behind their calculations, or else what is not an inherently difficult topic becomes almost completely impossible to understand to the fullest. I felt lost for a good portion of this quarter, and I read the textbook multiple times, did the problems we were assigned and then some, and continually didn't feel like my grasp of the material was strong enough to constitute mastery or preparedness for an exam. Professor MacIver put a lot of effort into making the course amenable to students, but I think just in how discursive the lectures were and how long they took to convey information and how math-heavy the class is for what was taught from a mostly application-based perspective, a lot of his efforts fell short.",
                "MacIver's lecture style made it impossible to learn the material in this class. I think if he vastly improved his lecture style, this course would be about fifty times easier and fifty times less frustrating. Also, the labs are way too long and repetitive.",
                "MacIver was new to teaching and SO super cool and nice, but he really had trouble with calibrating the pace and the rigor of the class. The first exam was okay, the makeup exam was crazy difficult, and the final was super reasonable. I had a lot of trouble knowing what was going to be tested, and the syllabus was completely wrong.",
                "This class could have been good if it were taught in a different manner. The labs were tedious and covered topics that we hadn't covered in class yet, so it was difficult to get much out of them. No solutions were ever given to homework problems so it was impossible to do practice problems in preparation for tests. It theoretically should have been a really easy class, but there number of resources to learn from was lacking, with the only helpful ones being the textbook and peer mentor.",
                "This class was not taught very well at all, the textbook and resources given were not sufficient to help us learn the topics. It was mostly self-taught, and you have to go to office hours if you want to do well. Overall, the material was not super difficult, but learning it was not easy.",
                "The actual material is not that hard; however, trying to figure out what you need to know is a struggle.",
                "This course needs to be remodeled. Most of the important concepts were taught very quickly or not at all. We were completely unprepared for the homeworks and labs. The professor and TA were not too helpful. Exams were fair as long as you can teach yourself the material.",
                "He\u2019s a nice person and he seemed to care how we did and that we learned, but he didn\u2019t really know how to make that happen. The class was so unorganized and unclear. Homeworks were always due different days and some weeks not others, labs were inconsistent I never knew if the upcoming weekend I was going to have to devote 10+ hours on a saturday to finishing a lab or not (yes, that happened, it's crazy). Quizzes on Monday would include stuff we literally learned the morning of and barely had time to actually learn and cram before the quiz. Studying didn\u2019t align with a good score because it was really arbitrary what we would be quizzed on.",
                "Lectures\u2026he spent a lot of time writing sentences and words, a lot of which was word for word reiterated from the textbook. And if he did examples they were often the same ones from the book. So the book did not supplement lecture and lecture did not supplement the book unfortunately. It would have been so helpful to actually do different examples in class so I could actually learn the concepts later on on my own. And speaking of examples, I wish he didn\u2019t just keep them general but instead used examples of a problem we may be given on homework or a test, instead of just the general formula definition with variables. What we learned in class did not prepare us for what kinds of problems we were faced with figuring out on the homeworks, let alone tests and quizzes. I used google and you tube videos to learn so much of what I ended up knowing how to do. We were given labs on things we didn\u2019t learn until 2-3 weeks later so they took a ridiculously unneccesary amount of time and kind of made no sense or i didn't have the background to understand what I was doing with matlab. Towards the end of the class we were all of a sudden expected to do a bunch of proofs for some reason which is not at all what the class was up until then. He spent a lot of time trying to convince us that signals were important, which is fine and great and I get that, but teach me how to actually do the math. And I don\u2019t learn by \u201cplaying with signals\u201d on matlab, I learn by doing concrete examples with numbers on paper, especially since that is what we are expected to do on a test. The content itself is not hard, but it was presented not in a clear step by step way so it seemed really confusing, and steps were often skipped and math steps not written out or explained, and I didn\u2019t have enough examples to compare to see how to apply a concept to different problems. We never are able to see solutions to any of the problems we do in homework that we get wrong (it\u2019s just marked wrong) or any of the other practice problems in the book. So we can\u2019t learn from our mistakes, and also I really understand problems by seeing examples of how they are supposed to be done and then I make sense of it. And we\u2019ve had basically none of that. The class was just made a lot harder, more complicated, and with more stress and anxiety and time than I think it needed to be or should have been. And what I put into it didn't translate to what I got out of it so I felt pretty defeated by the end. Hoping this will change for next year though so maybe it'll be better.",
                "This course has easily been my least favorite class that I have taken here at NU. The lectures were extremely unorganized, half of the in class examples had mistakes in them, the tests and homeworks were unnecessarily difficult, and solutions to these were not distributed, so they was no way of knowing why you did something wrong/how to fix it. Office hours were basically required to be successful in this class, so if they didn't fit in with your schedule, you were pretty much screwed.",
                "This class material was okay and not too hard but the way it was presented made it much more difficult than it needed to be. It almost moved too slow also.",
                "It felt like the professor was just reiterating the book. I'm not convinced he understood the content fully. Much of the class did not attend his lectures because of this. In addition, we didn't even go through one of the big 3 concepts that were supposed to be covered in this class.",
                "This class was a mess. The stuff we learned in the first two weeks seems completely irrelevant to the actual course objectives, we would have to complete (Matlab) labs on topics we had yet to learn in class, we weren't given the solutions to any homework problems so we didn't know what we did wrong, some of the \"quizzes\" were way too long, the prof didn't seem to have a great grasp of the material (at least not well enough to communicate these concepts to students who have never heard of these things before), etc. Honestly the material doesn't even seem to be that hard but the way in which it is presented makes it really hard to learn it. Hopefully this class will be structured better next year.",
                "This was rough. The professor made this course 100 times harder than it needed to be. The lectures were characterized by the professor writing on his Microsoft Surface almost illegibly with too many words and nowhere near enough examples. He was unable to go through an example problem and explain why he was taking the steps he took. A very poor experience.",
                "This is a math-heavy course, and it's not harder than ones you've already taken. The professor is OK at explaining things, but not especially good. That plus the fact that homework is taken from the textbook means you do need to rent or buy it. The TA for the class was Urgurcan, who is not good at explaining things and is a very demanding grader.",
                "THIS CLASS WAS AWFUL. I'm truly sorry that you have to take it, and I really hope it gets better for you. The course lacked any organization - couldn't use the syllabus because it wasn't what our professor followed, professor constantly stated that we were falling behind (despite not even learning the material effectively when covering it the first time), and there were no example questions we could work on practicing with because no solutions were posted online. The labs were awful and disconnected from the course because we had not covered the material prior to completing the labs - and overall this class sucked. Good luck.",
                "The teacher did not really know what he was doing. He was a very nice guy who was very excited and motivated and I think that he has the potential to be a good teacher in the future. However, he essentially wrote out full sentences from the text book on the lectures which were just generally not even readable in the first place. He also failed to demonstrate with examples or give us any resources for the course including solutions to any of the problem sets, quizzes, or tests for reference.",
                "Course structure lacking, resulting in confusion and ineffective use of time.",
                "The material itself wasn't that bad, reading the book and going to TA and student peer office hours was really helpful.",
                "This course helped me learn a bit about signals, but not all of the material from the syllabus was covered in lecture. The lectures were difficult to understand.",
                "Wow. What to say about BME 306. Malcolm seems to be a pretty nice guy that keeps rambling on about specifics of a subject of which almost literally no one understands the basics. He clearly has never spoken to Hao Zhang (the instructor of BME 305) about what we did or learned in that class and therefore expects us to have random knowledge that we don't have and continues speaking about things we've already done. Add to all of this the fact that the class is in complete disarray, with not even the syllabus getting an update from year to year."

Ian was a great instructor and there were so many TA's that grading was always done fast and there was always someone to answer any questions. The use of Piazza helped a lot as well. My only experience with programming was Matlab and R and I still found this course very well paced and easy to comprehend. I do wish we learned some more imperative programming languages like C or Java, but learning functional programming through Racket has it's merits.",

I learned the most from the tutorial sessions. Make sure you understand how to do the homework exercises as many of them are very long and take a long time to finish. Lots of office hours available. Though Racket is not a very useful language, I would definitely recommend to anyone else who has no experience in computer science to start with this class.",
                "Material is good. Coding language is kind of annoying and I have heard that we don't use it much going forward, but was very effective in teaching us basic concepts. The lectures were a little bland and I felt like I didn't have much motivation to go, which affected my learning.",

                "This is an easy course if you're ready to spend some time understanding the logic behind coding. Good intro class! Ian is a great professor, really fun!",
                "The content was rather easy to learn and understand, but the homework was either very easy or very hard depending on how well you understand the covered topics and how deep the application of the concepts was. I overall enjoyed the course and Ian is a great professor who knows what he's teaching. The quizzes given are pretty easy compared to the homework.",
                "I loved the professor and the way the course is organized (1 assignment per week and 3 quizzes).",
                "This class is hard and takes a lot of work. Lecture wasn't too useful at all, go to as many office hours as you can.",
                "This class is good to further your knowledge on Dr. Racket. Lectures are pretty much the slides, so attending class isn't necessary.",
                "the course is okay, but programming in racket is annoying. I don't recommend taking this class if you don't have to.",
                "I really liked this course. It was difficult for me being a beginner, but Ian was a really great instructor and the undergrad TAs were amazing. The assignments were structured so that you had enough time to get help if you needed it and ensure that you were doing it right. It's a little irritating that Racket is not actually used in the real world, but I understand the logic behind using a teaching language. Definitely not an easy class (for me anyway) but still very manageable to get a good grade. I probably would not have passed this class without going to the TAs' office hours; Sasha, Shane, and Will were super helpful.",
                "The professor was good, but the language itself, Racket, is dumb.",
                "Racket is really frustrating if you're used to Java or really any other language, but Ian is a great teacher, and the quizes are fair (make sure to familiarize yourself with the format ahead of time). All in all, EECS 111 is a good class, but could be better if the language it used wasn't so annoying at times.",
                "Needs more assessments, only had one quiz grade before reading week.",
                "Learnt a lot in this course. Not too hard.",
                "The course is not very time-consuming, and Ian is a great professor. TA discussions are very interactive and helpful. Homeworks can be difficult especially for a beginner programmer like myself. Paying attention in lectures is important to success. The beginning of the course is very easy and will catch you off guard because it gets much more difficult.",
                "Lectures were kind of boring, but the homeworks were really interesting and that was really where the learning happened.",
                "Supposedly, the language is difficult to understand. There are many frustrating things about this class, especially if you haven't coded before. But the TAs are great, especially Sarah, and the teacher is helpful. If you want to learn the \"logic\" of coding, a helpful class.",
                "If you don't have a background in programming, this is not a course for you. It really doesn't teach foundations for beginners - it teaches important topics for people who already have a strong background in programming. This class leaves people behind to fail. For instance the final exam - yeah, over 70 people got less than half of the problems right, but because most of the class is CS majors who have seen this stuff before, the mean was an 80% and over 100 people got an A on the exam. Additionally, some of the peer mentors (basically TAs) will make you feel stupid for not getting concepts and then they'll insinuate that you're wasting their time and the time of your classmates by going to office hours. But really it's just because this class is for people who are serious about programming, or at least that's how they look at it.",
                "I loved Ian's lectures, they were interesting and had a lot of background information about computer science (which some may not like). Overall the course isn't too hard and is manageable if you pay half-attention during lecture and understand the hw codes.",
                "Wasn't too interested. Racket isn't a very nice language.",
                "Really enjoyable class. Great intro class for not only CS majors but anyone interested in programming. Ian makes the information accessible to all students and really encourages everyone to do well in the class. TA's are a hit or miss. Head TA's know exactly what they're doing but some other TA's have no idea what they're doing.",
                "Was a good overall class.",
                "This course was fantastic at teaching basic computer science techniques, but the language was utterly useless.",
                "Ian Horswill is awesome, but lectures did not really help with learning the material. Also Racket is not a good language.",
                "Ok class, find people to work with you, programming concepts same as others.",
                "I felt that the course could have been taught in a less abstract way since the professor often times really abstracted or went off on tangents. The lectures seemed to be a little boring, especially near the end and that did not help. Perhaps if there were examples questions given in class or even just physically writing code in front of us could have been more useful. Other than that, the office hours were bountiful and spread out which was very useful and the tutorials were useful resources for understanding how to do certain topics like recursion or imperative programming.",
                "I didn't really learn what I expected to, and I feel like it didn't make me very excited about programming. The material was very mildly interesting, and not too hard. I did learn some concepts which I now understand are applicable to all languages, but I think the class could be improved.",
                "The tests were fair, the exercises were difficult and there were too many of them (why was one due during finals week?), and Ian was cool",
                "excellent introduction of computer science concepts. There are people who whine and complain that Racket's useless, but as someone who's taken two comp sci classes before this, I can say that it is an excellent survey of fundamental CONCEPTS in computer science, which is very important because this knowledge will carry over when you're trying to learn other programs.",
                "Interesting course overall, but not super useful just because we use Racket.",
                "Learned tons without putting in a whole lot of effort. Honest attendance is enough to get most any student through, Ian is great but can move a little slow. Easy tests, overall a great class",
                "This was a very solid introduction to programming. Prof. Horswill is a very clear lecturer and very willing to answer questions. This class will be fairly simple if you took AP Comp Sci or have other programming experience. If anything, you will gain a better grasp on recursion.",
                "Great class. I mostly learned through homework. Tests were really easy. Ian is a great professor. Lectures are interesting but definitely not necessary to do well in the class.",
                "The course should have been taught in a more applicable computer language such as Python or C++ as they are much more useable in jobs later on than Racket.",
                "Very disappointed with this class. I'm a computer science major, so this class is required, but I was not happy at all. The language we used, Racket, is a waste of time and useless in the real world. If you have no programming experience it's probably helpful to learn concepts like recursion, but as someone who already knew all the concepts taught in this class, it was very hard to motivate myself to relearn these concepts in a useless language that is literally never used outside of this class.",
                "Good",
                "The first few weeks were easy since we didn't really get any homework and the homework exercises were easy. However, at around week 5 or 6 everything got SUPER hard, especially if you started to relax and take it easy since you thought the first few weeks were easy. Basically, don't fall behind and you should be fine.",
                "The homework assignments were very difficult and I wish the course was a bit more practical and was taught in a language commonly used. The quizzes were not too bad though",
                "If you want to learn programming, this is to the course. Do one on a particular language. However, it's an easy A and a moderately interesting class.",
                "This class made me want to be a computer science major.",
                "Great class for learning about computer science concepts.",
                "It was labeled as a beginner class but as a student coming out of AP computer science it still felt extremely difficult.",
                "Ian tends to go really slow on the easy concepts and really fast on the harder concepts, the course can be initially really really hard for someone who has had zero programming experience. The programs are really, really difficult to do after the first few, but the quizzes are definitely doable if you practice a lot of problems and you know what kinds of problems to look out for.",
                "This class is great to take if you want to figure out if you like coding or not. Overall easy but also challenging (the assignments could be hard and not well explained)",
                "The course did focus on all the topics it was supposed to.",
                "The programming language used in this course initially did not feel too comfortable too use, so even if you've programmed in the past, there's a period of adjustment needed before you acclimate to the rhythm of the course. The class itself, however, is really not asking too much. If you just complete the weekly assignments and attend the tutorial sessions, the class should not slay you. For new programmers though, there's likely going to be a learning curve, although office hours and Sunday recitations (where a TA goes over and reviews material covered in the past week's lecture) should be sufficient to help you stay on track.",
                "I think this is a good class but I think they need to rethink how it is taught. I feel completely unprepared to do the homeworks and rely solely on office hours to complete them. Also, TAs should have access to the homework answers because often times they won't know an answer to a homework problem either. Homeworks should either be easier or be worth more because they take up so much time.",
                "I had heard that this class would be easy with prior programming experience, but that was definitely not the case. I never learned anything in lecture, and the \"quizzes\" were too difficult given that there was basically no way to study for them besides the practice quiz.",
                "Course and instructor are interesting, but the language we use is disgusting.",
                "Didn't offer enough resources for learning outside of class, Ian was a good professor though.",
                "Ian is an engaging lecturer and the material is interesting. If you are familiar with programming this class won't be too difficult but there is still enough new information to make it worth your time.",
                "Tutorials were a waste of time and should be optional; they're only useful for students who are struggling and need extra support. Homework was way too easy due to the excessive amount of handholding (i.e., guidance and work already done for us). Since very little theory is introduced in this class, it's pretty much just a course that covers writing basic programs. As such, it would make so much more sense to work with a more useful and widely applicable programming language like Python instead of Racket. All in all, I don't see why EECS 111 exists. I took EECS 110 last year, and it was a far better course and could certainly replace 111 in my opinion.",
                "lol.",
                "Racket seemed like a bad language to start out in, I was lost for a lot of it",
                "The language used in this class is by far the strangest I have ever seen and I'm not a huge fan. That being said, it's not too difficult to pick up on, the syntax is just strange.",
                "The class is as interesting as a class taught for a 200-person lecture hall can ever be. Ian is engaging, friendly, very funny and brilliant, and the material is well designed. The assignments are fun enough to do that I legitimately look forward to doing my homework. The only complaints I have are the complete lack of individual attention that is inevitable in a massive lecture hall, and which makes participation effectively impossible for anyone who isn't lunatically brave. However, be warned that this class teaches in a useless programming language because it communicates concepts very well, which is a cool thing for the long haul and I've heard pays off wonderfully for the major eventually, but is a bit frustrating since you can't do all that much in the real world until like three classes from now.",
                "This was not my most favorite class. It's difficult to learn coding quickly and effectively, so this class required, at least for me, going to any and all office hours to complete the homeworks.",
                "Don't try to study for this class alone. It can be confusing. Go to office hours and find classmates to work through practice tests.",
                "Have to put in the work to do the exercises and the quizzes are rather difficult",
                "The homework was really important. It really helped me learn. I wish I would have taken it more seriously.",
                "Only take it if you have to. I was excited to learn to code but this isn't the class for that. This is the class where everyone is passing code along (probably taken from the 1% who knows what they are doing or has coded a lot before). The lectures and tutorials DO NOT prepare you for the homework. Also, the student TAs have less of an idea of what is going on than the current students. The only time they are ever helpful is when they just feed you code. worst class ever.",
                "This class is not introductory. The homework assignments are long and difficult, and lectures are confusing at best for someone who has little to no exposure to computer science. The language is obscure and the assignments are so stressful that I was doing them only for the grade not to learn the material because I felt pressed for time always.",
                "The homework is really hard and will take up a lot of your time. In comparison the quizzes are extremely easy. Lecture is not that helpful if you are someone who is easily distracted because its not very engaging.",
                "DrRacket is annoying to learn if you took AP Computer Science in high school and learned Java or a different language. Ian is a good professor and his slides are understandable, but usually they are easier to comprehend than the exercise programs that are due each week. Having a good TA is essential to asking questions about these exercises.",
                "This course was very fun. Ian is a wonderful speaker and engages you strongly when teaching the course. As someone who has done computer programming for years, I did not learn many new ideas about programming during this course, but it was a good and engaging refresher course on basic computer programming.",
                "The homework assignments for this class were so very difficult for me, however there were many office hours posted and the quizzes were not that bad.",
                "This class seems really easy at first, but then it gets you real quick. Ian teaches well, but he teaches at more of a conceptual level. The tutorials were great for applying the concepts.",
                "Pretty challenging if you don't know anything about CS, lectures do not help to clarify anything. Make friends to study and figure out homework with, otherwise you will never be able to do well.",
                "I was super rusty with my coding skills and it brought me back up to speed. The usage of Racket as the language really levels the playing field so that people who don't have much experience with programming can do as well as the people who have a lot of experience. It was a fun course and I\u027d recommend it to nonmajors because if you like puzzle-solving, you'll probably like coding. Also, you can ask for an extension every week, which really helped spread out my workload.",
                "Don't take it without a friend.",
                "Ian is the best professor ever.",
                "Ian was a pretty good prof. Exercises and tests weren't too bad, there are a lot of TAs so lots of opportunities for office hours but also some are hit-or-miss. A strange mix between moving too slow for the coding-experienced and too fast for the non-experienced, though.",
                "SO HARD OMG IF YOU DONT LIKE COMPUTER SCIENCE!!! DO NOT TAKE THIS AS A DISTRO!!!! OMG!!!!",
                "Ian was a great prof. The Exercises do get pretty tough so thats annoying but the quizzes were easy.",
                "This is a great course to get an introduction to functional programming\u02fcomputer science. The professor and TAs make themselves very open to helping you. The work is manageable and the topics range in difficulty.",
                "Professor Horswill explains the material quite well. The class itself does get progressively difficult, and the homework assignments can be difficult. The quizzes are a lot easier. There are a lot of TA's in this course, but most of them were not helpful at all during office hours. They were very under-prepared and would often not do the course work themselves. Overall, you should expect to do more work than the course number would suggest, but it's an interesting class nonetheless.",
                "Easy course if you have background in the subject. If not, racket can be really confusing at times.",
                "Racket definitely is not the most fun language to work with. It is not nearly as intuitive as many other languages are, and i saw more than one friend drop out of the course because it was taught in a strange language.",
                "Racket seemed like a useless language, but a lot of the topics are similar to higher-ended programming.",
                "It is like a nice introduction.",
                "As a Kellogg student, this class is great.",
                "This is a good class for people who have never programmed before... and those people only. The department must waive this class for students who have taken AP CS already. Using an esoteric language like Dr. Racket does NOT '\u027even the playing field'' for people who understand programming... it just annoys people who dislike Scheme. Personally, EECS 111 was a waste of my time. The AP class was far more challenging. If you can program and have to take this class for a requirement, here's some advice: skip lecture and use that time to build side projects.",
                "I knew the material before the course, making it a breeze. Almost a waste of my time. But I feel like this class is a good introduction to people who are new at programming. It would have been helpful for me like 3 years ago.",
                "The course was very well designed for an intro course, it was thorough and went through all the fundamentals.",
                "The main coding language in this class is challenging, but places emphasis on the foundations of coding",
                "This course is a well-structured introduction to programming. The lectures are huge, but they try to compensate that with small tutorial sessions. Lecture was often dry, but the class is definitely manageable.",
                "Having no past experience in programming, I greatly enjoyed this course. I took it purely to see what the class is about. However, it is an introductory class and I was disappointed that most students already had copious amounts of prior knowledge.",
                "It definitely made me want to enroll in more EECS courses and learn more about the discipline.",
                "Ian is a great guy and great professor, this course is not too challenging or time consuming.",
                "Very very easy to fall behind",
                "Decent class that would be totally doable for first-time coders. Pretty much all review for people who have taken AP Comp Sci so not that challenging. Weekly projects don't take too much time and there's an army of TA's so lots of help available",
                "PROS: Racket language is fun, Fun assignments (video game!), Learn a lot, Easy quizzes.",
                "CONS: Time consuming weekly assignments. They take about 4-9 hours to do. TAs are not that helpful. Discussion/tutorial is useless but you have to go anyway.",
                "OVERALL: This class is meh. If I could go back in time, I would probably not take it. For the most part, you learn a lot but the class is quite tedious. Towards the second half of the class, I never went to lecture at all and could still complete the assignments and do somewhat well on quizzes. ONLY TAKE IT IF YOU NEED IT FOR THE MAJOR!",
                "The lecture and exam material is relatively easy, but there is a huge discrepancy when one compares it to what is on the homework programs, which can get unnecessarily hard, in my opinion.",
                "I thought it was odd that they put a mix of people with and without coding experience into the same class. The new language of DrRacket (which is kind of the worst, different from most languages you'll encounter) kind of levels the playing field, but having a programming mindset still helps. The lectures however aren't too intense, and the tutorials are relaxed and especially helpful if you have a good TA.",
                "You get what you put into this class. If you do your own work and go to class, you will do well. It's really easy to slack off, but it's even easier to do well if you just show up and do your own work.",
                "A good first computer science class. Gives a foundation for a variety of concepts. Lectures aren't always focused and could be more clear but overall not a super hard class.",
                "Prof. Ian is amazing. I really like the way he teach. The course is not very hard but stimulate your interest in programming.",
                "not the best class but I had a great TA and I like coding.",
                "This course was relatively confusing to me. Instead of simply teaching a programming language it taught the conceptual side of programming. Probably a great course for programmers looking to learn about a different side of CS. As a first time programmer, I found this course really difficult. There was a lot of computing jargon that just did not make sense to me.",
                "Pay attention to where the parenthesis go!",
                "I came into this class knowing absolutely nothing about computer programming and I learned so much! It really allows you to build your knowledge from the ground up without feeling pressured. The TAs are so friendly and office hours have saved my life time and time again.",
                "The most impotant thing to me was learning to think differently",
                "Lots of homework",
                "I wanted to see if I enjoyed coding and if it was potentially something I would like to pursue and it is",
                "Horswill does a great job of keeping students entertained during lectures. Heard Sood is easier, but definitely no complaints about Horswill.",
                "Good introduction class to coding, Racket gets a little annoying at times.",
                "Assignments can be nice challenges. Lectures are kind of boring but what can you expect from a 300 person class?",
                "Certain concepts were incredibly hard, however, the vast majority was too simple.",
                "The course was extremely tough, but helped me learn a good amount about computer programming",
                "It was a very challenging class. The lectures did not make sense and the homework programs took forever to complete.",
                "Do not take this class with Horsewill, He is not a good lecturer and he does not care about how his students do in the class. The assignments were confusing and not a good reflection of the material.",
                "Overall, the tests weren't too bad, if you study the practice tests and his slides you'll do fine. Also, even though the exercises are challenging they really do help in understanding how the procedures apply to a language. There's also A LOT of office hours available so you can get help to do your homework. Take advantage of them!",
                "This is a great intro to programming class. If you are even considering Comp sci as a minor take this class to see if you like it. For assignments, go to TA office hours they are extremely helpful!!",
                "It is a nice course for introduction into programming",
                "I took this course to see if I would be interested in computer science, but unfortunately, this course was not structured in a way that helped me realize if I cs is something that I would like to pursue or not. I felt as though I was struggling to keep up with the students who already had cs experience.",
                "The coding language learned is not really relevant to languages used in the world today so that was disappointing. But I did have a lot of fun in this class as I was learning the design process and that would be able to transfer over to other languages which would help me a lot in the future.",
                "Not too hard of a course and learned a lot about programming.",
                "Racket is quite a pain to learn.",
                "A fantastic intro to computer programming. Don't take that to mean it's easy, though. Definitely one of the harder courses I took this quarter.",
                "I enjoyed this course. Ian is a pretty good teacher and a pretty chill guy and clearly has a love for programming. The work load isn't bad at all: just one exercise per week due every Friday (you can get an extension until Sunday any and every week if you choose) and a one hour \"tutorial\" session at whatever time you choose during the week (I would recommend earlier in the week because it sometimes helps with the exercises). While I and most others don't love the Racket language or at least its syntax (Parentheses. Parentheses everywhere.), I can understand why it is used to teach us the basics. The fact that this course dealt with such a low-level language helped me to better understand concepts like recursion that you wouldn't encounter in other higher-level languages such that have loops and other things programmed in and what not. All in all, I would recommend this class to anyone taking this course who has an interest in learning to program as a discipline and is still useful even if you are planning on only learning a single language for whatever reason. Previous programming experience is certainly not required, though it does help of course.",
                "I learned a lot, but failed to see the usefulness of learning the language DrRacket",
                "A fine course!",
                "I thought the course was interesting and was really impressed by the amount of resources that this course had. I was able to get help in SOOO many different ways which was really comforting and helpful. Lectures did not help in understanding the course though.",
                "The lectures do not help with me trying to learn. If you don't learn well through just being lectured then this class is not for you. Also the TAs are snakes because a lot of them were not at their office hours",
                "Having already coded before, this class was very frustrating. The pace seemed slower than an average class and I don't think that it would provide that great an understanding of coding or the logic behind it had I never coded before. There wasn't much emphasis on how to approach problems or solve them as much as explaining how to do simple tasks in a language that doesn't have much practical use (Dr. Racket). The tests were not a reflection of one's ability to write or even understand code as much as they were how well you could memorize the syntax patterns for Dr. Racket",
                "The language is kind of annoying at times, but pretty basic. The TAs are helpful if you go to office hours--in my opinion, the lectures weren't very helpful, but a lot of people thought they were. Overall, this course is very helpful for gauging whether or not programming is a good match for you.",

                "It was a hard course, especially for someone with no CS experience",
                "I enjoyed learning about the fundamental, abstract ideas of the course but I wish we had learned a more useful and applicable language than Racket. I did not find the lectures to be entirely helpful either.",
                "good course, pretty well organized",
                "111 is a great intro class. Although DrRacket may seem silly sometimes, it is a very simple, straight to point language to learn. It was my first time learning programming but if you follow the class and do exercise on your own, you will be able to pull it off and learn a lot.",

                "This class will be difficult if you have no prior coding experience. Take it if you have to, but it may be an overload if you want to take it as an elective. DrRacket is such an odd programming language.",
                "I think this is a well done intro class, the sheer army of TA's and tutorial sessions mean help is always at the ready and you still get to learn hands on in small groups",
                "EECS 111 was by far my hardest class this quarter. I do not know if it was the teaching or if it was the material. I could not understand why codes were written how they were and even spending hours trying to study and learn and practice the code myself, it was infuriating. I also strongly disliked the language of Racket as well. It doesn't seem applicable anywhere but in class.",
                "This course is manageable. Lectures are not mandatory. If you have a background in programming, just follow up on the content through lecture slides. Spend time on the assignments and check them, double check them, triple check them. Take your time on the quizzes. 3 quizzes, each 25 % of your final grade, last quiz cumulative.",
                "This course is difficult but taught the fundamentals of programming.",
                "Racket is a very irritating language. Ian is cool and the tutorial system is a great way to get one on one help when you need it and brush up on things you learned during lecture.",
                "THIS CLASS IS A TRAP DON'T TAKE IT UNLESS YOU PLAN TO BE COMP SCI MAJOR OR HAVE EXPERIENCE IN CODING! NOT FOR PEOPLE NEW TO CODING I REPEAT! THIS IS A TRAP!",
                "This course is not for beginners. Unless you have a ton of coding experience, you will fail in this class unless you have someone to copy homework from. The lectures don't prepare you for the homeworks, and the homeworks don't prepare you for the tests. It's a huge mess that will screw you over. Most of the ta's don't know what's going on either and are more confused than you are. Ian also is not the most understanding guy.",
                "The class, despite being taught in a language that is not applicable outside of the class, does help people who do not have coding experience like me gain a fundamental understanding of the rationale and thought process behind coding. The class is not very difficult and the work isn't excessive. That said, there is basically no curve for the class because everyone does super well.",
                "It was a perfect introduction to computer programming. Very easy and entertaining, but you still learn a lot.",
                "Great class, Ian makes his instructions very clear on all assignments and lecture slides to help facilitate learning outside of class. Assignments were occasionally hard and takes a bit of time. Exams are very straight forward."

The tests were much easier than the homework and really focused on the crucial aspect of the language that you needed to know. I felt behind from most of my class because I did not have coding experience.",
                "I do feel like I learned, but I only learned through the lab section and the homework, never the lectures. They would often go too fast and the professor would not explain things very well. Also, Racket is not a very good beginning language because there is nothing else like Racket in the real world. Lastly, the partner system was awful. I ended up doing nearly all of the work on all of the assigned partner homeworks and it was incredibly difficult to find time that my partner and I could 'work' together. When we were able to choose our partners, that helped a lot.",
                "I learned the most from doing the homework, although the partner system needs improvement. Lectures were fast passed and hard to follow. Overall not to bad if you're willing to put in the time on assignments.",
                "This course was hard, especially with Professor Tov teaching it. He went over so many things and the TAs were extremely helpful.",
                "Winter and Spring quarters are completely different in the overall structure. This year, 2018, the Winter class focused on list processing and data stuff but barely touched GUI and state based game logic. Spring on the other hand had the opposite approach. Making games is a lot of fun however I'm told that 211 builds more on the Winter quarter skill set.",
                "Jesse Too teaches this class at a high level, including the homework being challenging and the lectures covering challenging material. The lectures were very hard to follow as the professor usually just drones on and codes for the entire hour and 20 minutes. You are expected to do over 25 pages of reading a night.",
                "Don't get scared away by the homework, that's the hardest part of the whole class.",
                "Overall, this course gave a good introduction to the principles of functional programming. However, it could have been good if it used a more popular program language instead of Racket, since Racket is rarely used in programming. A language like Python could be a much better alternative.",
                "Homework was extremely hard, tests were easier. If you want this to be an easy class don\u2019t take it with tov.",
                "The course is one in which you get pout of it what you put into it.",
                "Hard class for sure, and not a walk in the park even if you've coded before. Expect to put in 8+ hours later in the course on programs.",
                "I found this course challenging, and it took way more of my time and effort than I wanted considering I had to take it because I am a neuroscience major, and I don't plan on taking another computer science class. The homework assignments are incredibly difficult and time consuming, so make sure you start as early as you can and go to office hours.",
                "Jesse is a good professor and a good teacher as long as you are paying attention in class. Jesse's 111 has a reputation for being way harder than either of the other 111 sections, but if you pay attention and don't fall behind, it ends up being super worth it because you cover so much more interesting stuff in his class than in either of the others.",
                "I get the feeling Jesse cares about teaching and wants to do well, but the lectures are simply ineffective. Not overly difficult, but is more difficult than the other sections of 111.",
                "NOT a good INTRODUCTORY Computer Science course for beginners!! Take the other intro class first, or do NOT take 111 with JESSE if you have less than a major interest in computer science. It is kind of a filter class. If you really like computer science, you will enjoy the class.",
                "God",
                "I didn't love this course. I get that we're supposed to be \"learning how to program\" instead of learning racket, but I feel it would be more useful to learn a language that we might use again if we're going to continue in programming.",
                "This course is difficult but you learn a ton. If you've heard that Jesse's class is harder than Sara or Ian's that is 100% true so be prepared for a class that is a very obvious step up in difficulty from the other professors. If you're taking 111 for a low time-commitment easier intro class take it with a different instructor. That being said, we definitely learned more in this class than we otherwise would have. GO TO LECTURE. Jesse posts all his code from lecture but it's really hard to follow them if you don't have a reference point from going to class. Lab sections are good to brush up on stuff from the week that doesn't make sense. We have a homework program due every week that range a lot in difficulty. The harder ones can take upwards of 7ish hours. Don't think I would have passed this class without office hours, some of the programs are so hard if you can't talk with someone who knows what they're doing. The homework programs are definitely harder than the exams in my opinion. First exam is really easy and the average is super high, second one is quite a bit harder and definitely requires a lot more studying. Overall I really liked this class. You learn a TON and finishing the programs is really rewarding but it's not a class that you can do well in with minimal effort. TLDR: If you want an easy 111 take with Sara or Ian, if you want to learn more take it with Jesse.",
                "As others have said, Tov is definitely harder than the other EECS 111 professors, but he honestly helped me learn on my own. Much of this class relies on making connections on your own and learning by doing. Although Tov's style isn't for everyone, I can definitely say that I learned in this course. Also, the exams are less complicated than the homework, so just be sure to confidently understand what every type of function does and you should be fine.",
                "I learned to code solely because of this course",
                "Everyone says that the class with Tov is the most difficult 111 class. That is true if you have no previous CS experience. If you do have CS experience, taking the class with Tov will not seem that difficult.",
                "Kinda boring and fairly easy, but I don't think it should be made any harder.",
                "The class is not as bad as other people make it sound. If you do all the homeworks properly, the midterms shouldn't be a problem. Also, do make use of the peer TA hours, it's really helpful!",
                "Racket is a useless language. This course is redundant and useless for EECS majors.",
                "oh oh oh oh and this bird you cannot change",
                "Lots of people did not pay attention during the lectures, but I found it helpful, even though Jesse can go over things pretty fast at times. However, most of the learning can be done through doing the homework and going over the notes posted for each class session.",
                "There is a learning curve to this course, especially with Jesse. He moves very quickly in lecture and it's difficult to follow along if you try to type along with him. I recommend doing to reading outside of class if you can, then downloading the lecture notes (he puts all notes online) and follow along with him. Try to focus on his explanations and how that's translated into the code. Jesse genuinely cares about his students and wants you guys to learn, he's just a little hard to follow at times, so try to follow along as best you can and ask questions when you're confused. He's good about leaving time for questions. Good luck!",
                "This course is harder than expected, especially with Jesse Tov. The exams aren't hard, but the homeworks can be. There's also quizzes at the beginning of every class that are pass\u2ffail that are sometimes hard.",
                "Overall the course provides a good introduction to programming and an understanding of the programming design process.",
                "This class is really challenging and hard to follow. It can be difficult to pay attention in class, so make sure to take notes on paper or on the program. The homeworks are difficult and challenging, but if you get started early and go to office hours they are doable. Overall, I ended up learning a lot from the class, even though it was hard to realize it during the class.",
                "Study for the tests, Jesse is really tough",
                "This class moves fast, definitely difficult if you have no programing experience. If you don't have experience you might want to take it with a different teacher.",
                "People complain about the teaching style of this class, but I think it actually one of the best-taught classes I have taken thus far. The language used isn't used anywhere outside of the class but it is chosen for good reason. The program has unique functionality that helps you to learn how programming works, and has simplifications that wouldn't be used in a language built for efficiency, but make learning to code less confusing. The professor provides copies of each classes notes in the form of code online, which is very useful when doing homework, which also does a good job of teaching information itself. The professor holds daily quizzes, which can be stressful, but they serve as a good check to see if you have been understanding class, and do not count much for your grade. The professor also provides useful study guides and practice tests before the midterms that do a good job of covering the necessary information. One important thing to know about the class is that you shouldn't try to type the code along him in class. You will just end up falling behind him and missing the point. Instead, it is best to just follow along, take notes if necessary, and look at the code he post online if you find something confusing or did not understand the lecture.",
                "Was a very good intro into basic programming structure and style.",
                "Functional Programming will actually be helpful in your future CS career. However, it is not the \"best\" for getting an internship. But it's important to learn it to set groundwork for yourself."

I also liked the way the chapter/subject matter was arranged because I felt it built off each other well.",

There was not a lot of guidance with specific commands, so I had to look a lot of them up online, which could sometimes be confusing. Live codes during class are hard to keep up with. The hw codes can get difficult and time consuming really fast, so make sure you start really really early!",

For those who have not had prior coding experience outside of the prerequisite course, make sure to frequently go to office hours for help, unless you consider yourself to be an extremely quick learner. The pace of the class is relatively fast, so make sure to stay on top of things.",

                "Lectures were not very applicable/useful to me but the homeworks really helped challenge my understanding (as someone who has previous coding experience). Tests weren't that bad but punished silly mistakes (1 mistake could easily be 5% or more).",
                "I enjoyed the content of the course for the most part. It was sometimes dull but on the whole I'm happy I took it",
                "This class is a great introductory course into learning C++. You learn the nuances of object-oriented programming, classes, memory allocation, and C++-specific utilities such as pointers. The lectures are dry and seem to drag on (I had trouble focusing for the entire 80 minute period), but the lab sessions and homework programs are very stimulating and informative.",
                "I was interested in learning a new language but while taking it I was unhappy with it. The course did not do a good job of teaching me.",

His online grading system for the homework was pretty ok, but sometimes the tests didn't work on code that was functional due to CLion compiling things differently on Macs vs PCs. Make sure your partner has a Mac/Linux if you don't so you can avoid the sadness that comes from having to ask him to reopen an assignment because you swear the code works on your computer.",

                "Tov is probably one of the worst *instructors* that I've had here in terms of pure teaching ability in lecture, but he is one of the fairest and most reasonable professors I've had here. His lectures weren't interesting and quite painful to sit through, and I ended up teaching myself the course through Sarah Sood's 211 lecture slides (which you should take instead of this class in the fall or spring). However, the exams were very fair, and they are not meant to trick you in the slightest. They are very straightforward. The PSETS are very hard, but they teach you a lot, definitely go to office hours, because the TAs are super helpful. Tov is a really reasonable person, he just can't teach effectively unfortunately.",
                "Jesse can often move fast in class, but he's definitely willing to slow it down as long as you speak up. This class isn't too difficult especially because 70% of your grade is determined by how well you do on your homework.",
                "Intellectually challenging course. Homeworks can be tough but are meant for you to succeed and learn by doing. Jesse may be a poor/unengaging lecturer but he truly wants his students to succeed and his very helpful answering questions",
                "The best advice I can give: TA hours. They were probably the saving grace for me in this class. I really would have failed this class without them, no joke. Professor Tov is one of the nicest professors, letting you resubmit code if there was an error in the code that made you fail a lot of tests. I still do not like the written style midterms and wish there was a way to be tested by actually making code on a computer. Overall, this class is not difficult if you take advantage of TA hours and do not wait until the last day to write the code.",
                "I got very little out from lecture because of how disorganized it was. That said, content of the course is important to know.",
                "This course was designed for people with a moderate to high understanding of C++. I found the classes to be way too difficult and the assignments were way too difficult as well. My partner and I would spend 20+ hours on the homework and attend office hours and felt that the content was over our heads. The powerpoints were unclear and the code that was embedded in the lectures was unorganized.",
                "Tov knows his stuff, but sometimes struggles with properly teaching it during lecture. Make sure to go to Office Hours so you get a proper understanding of the material.",
                "For those who have taken AP Computer Science A before, this class is basically more or less a repeat of the class in C++ (so + pointers and memory management). Overall, lectures were decent, but most people didn't pay too much attention and could still get by. Find a partner who is willing to split work evenly for homework, as some of the later homework assignments do take a while to complete, albeit they are not extremely difficult. There is a larger than usual focus on testing, that is, a large portion of your grade is focused on whether you have specific tests or not, which can make testing a bit tedious. Jesse is quite nice on extensions and minor mistakes, so don't feel shy to reach out to him outside of class!",
                "Classes in Computer Science are always classes in which most of the learning takes place through homework and studying, which makes Tov's fairly ambiguous, clumsily made homeworks a fairly large problem. Like any EECS class, lectures are tolerable but not amazing, and you learn both annoying and cool techniques, but the badly made homeworks make the difficult transition to C++ and the learning of the more complicated concepts unnecessarily difficult, so it is probably wiser to take 211 with a better teacher if possible.",
                "This class was a bummer. On the first day of class, Dr. Tov scared everyone by jumping directly into Shell. The rest of the quarter did not improve; the professor would blaze through code, and ask, \"Are there any questions?\" Before the stunned students had time to formulate their questions, he would answer, \"good!\" and keep chugging on. Dr. Tov spends much of his time walking us through classes and concepts that are entirely irrelevant to the homework. We had to write a lot of unit tests. This has the good intention of forcing students to think about edge cases; however, it proved to be rather tedious, time-consuming, and unnecessary. It also had the drawback of docking points from assignments even when students passed all the instructor's tests but forgot to write a specific test on their own. EECS 211 should not have been difficult if it was explained properly. However, it ended up being a royal pain.",
                "This class made me want to drop the CS major. It was boring and lots of repeated material. Projects weren't very interesting and the instruction was not engaging and kind of all over the place",
                "It is a great class for C++ lovers. However, I feel the professor was not that great at teaching.",
                "It was an okay class, I enjoyed it and the material was pretty interesting",
                "This course is much better than EECS 111. C++ is a much more fun language to learn. Jesse is smart and nice, but not great at communicating the important concepts clearly. Programs are challenging but doable if you make the effort to meet with TAs. Utilizing Piazza is also important and the instructors and students are very active on it.",
                "Don't take it with jesse. The homeworks are really hard and its frustrating because the last 4 build off each other, so if you screw up the first one you cant do the other ones.",
                "Try, try, try. I learned that in order to gain a mastery of a language, I needed to practice.",
                "The point of the course was to teach you C++, and in my opinion it did it well.",
                "This course feels completely different than 111. I didn't know what was going on for 95% of this course.",
                "This is a fairly straightforward class covering most of the same topics also covered in a typical AP Computer Science course but in C++ instead of Java. Homework was straightforward, but did not facilitate much learning. Exams were quite easy.",
                "The course was very fast-paced, but a great introduction to a real programming language. While we learned the basics of C++, we also learn how to think about building programs and abstracting methods for efficient program design. This is a really self-motivated class, so if you don't go to lecture/write your own homework code, you won't understand the content. It feels hard to catch up once you're behind, so stay on top of the workload, force yourself to focus in class, and complete all the labs and homeworks.",
                "This course is poorly organized. Your grade is largely based (70%) on the homework assignments, which may seem like a good thing. The homeworks are cumulative projects. Each assignment relies upon a perfect score on the last assignment in order to do well.",
                "I think that this course was really interesting and helped stimulate my interest in computer science. that being said, i think the assignments were too difficult for an intro class.",
                "I think this course offers a lot of important programming concepts, not to mention the relevant language of C++, but the teaching style was always going over a few slides then coding for the rest of the 80 minute class, which was fine for me, someone who had 2 years of coding experience in high school, but not as helpful for beginner coders learning these concepts for the first time and trying to understand them while also following along with the code being quickly written on the screen. However you are allowed to do homework in pairs which is nice and encourages people to work together to figure it out which is great.",
                "It's okay.",
                "Professor Tov was a really great instructor and made every effort to clarify anything that is unclear. It could be said the class is lacking a bit of a structural organisation, however it didn't adversey affect learning experience. Also professor was really kind and would be happy to discuss your hw/test, extend a deadline for you if you have a reason, etc.",
                "I couldn't understand them.",
                "Lectures were helpful at all. I recommend skipping lecture and just going to office hours to get the work done. Exams were relatively easy",
                "Get a good partner if you are doing partner work. Mine quit and it caused huge problems for me and the class.",
                "The wordings used in homework instruction was so unclear that most of the time I'm just confused about what to do. Codes that were never introduced were often used in the codes that the instructor has written so most of the time in the lecture I just sat there without knowing what is going on.",
                "It's a nice class for introduction to c++ and Jesse has explained some complex ideas pretty well in lecture. However, I think the homework can be structured to make it less confusing for some part.",
                "Decent class overall. Homework is reasonable since Tov provides starter code that organizes the overall program. Midterm and final were both straight forward but tricky at times. However, class instructions are quite unclear, as he codes really quickly and expects you to be able to follow. Instructions for homework is also sometimes unclear, but having more than a dozen TA sections certainly helps.",
                "Make sure to start the homeworks early! The first few were not particularly challenging, but they become much more difficult towards the end of the course. Take advantage of office hours and Jesse is very accessible. The tests are not particularly difficult or weighted heavily. Get the homeworks done!",
                "Good project assignments, liked how projects worth more than tests",
                "This class essentially teaches you how to code in C++. Overall, the class is not very difficult and grades are based on 7\u02f8 homework assignments (10% each) and 2 midterms (15% each). Tov is a decent teacher although his classes can be boring and hard to understand at times. To be honest, going to class, while recommended, is not really necessary. All in all, it is a standard EECS 200 level class.",
                "It was an okay class. A lot of material and challenged me fairly well, but Tov's teaching style was a little dry",
                "The class was fairly simple at the beginning, but had a marked jump in difficulty halfway through and the instruction did not always match the homeworks",
                "This course was great at challenging me intellectually, as well as teaching me, because I went from nearly zero programming experience to a substantial amount in this class. I often had struggles doing the homework, but the tests were decently easy.",
                "Jesse is a smart and nice guy, but lectures tended to be overwhelming and hard to understand",
                "Learnt a lot as a non-CS major and C++ is a really useful programming language. The class was challenging and some homeworks required quite a lot of work but it was worth it.",
                "I had to take this for CS major, but it got very hard in the middle. The homeworks are much harder than the exams.",
                "The lectures for this course felt unnecessarily complicated and were not engaging. Slides were brief and often led into live coding for the second half of the class, which went by so quickly that it wasn't actually informative. Professor was nice, but not a good lecturer- take this class with another if available. Homeworks were time-consuming and often required assignment clarifications on Piazza / frantic OH visits on the days that they were due.",
                "Jesse's lectures are really impossible to follow along with. I don't really understand how so many people get C++ but in general, a really useful class that teaches you a crucial CS skill.",
                "Yes, it was challenging",
                "Lots of emphasis on homework, not too much on exams. Lecture not too helpful, mostly understand material when doing the HW problem sets.",
                "I didn't love this course because it took a ton of time, and I felt that going to lecture was pointless, which I don't think is the feeling I should get i a class is really stimulating. However, looking back on the stuff we learned in the beginning, I feel like I have learned a lot in this class that will be extremely helping in my Computer Science major.",
                "The homework is pretty challenging and time consuming.",
                "The pace is fast but Prof. Tov is very accessible and helpful.",
                "Tests were straightforward, but challenging. HW was extremely time consuming.",
                "I would high recommend against taking this class wth Tov. He explains basic ideas in a confusing, convoluted way and incorporates too much jargon. Because the lectures are so hard to follow, the homework are really tough, and take up a ton of time. Also, the grading of the homework is really rough because the instructions are very vague.",
                "Start your homeworks early, go to office hours early in the week",
                "I really enjoyed this course. Jesse was a fantastic lecturer, and I enjoyed the homework assignments.",
                "I wish that the topics were covered more in depth. In my opinion, it felt like the course was taught more as a review for people who already knew the material as opposed to teaching the new material, and as such the course didn't properly explain certain things and I spent a lot of time on online websites learning new concepts.",
                "Jesse is amazing and super smart -- he really cares about his students. Although his lectures are not super organized and go way too deep into the content, he's really good at helping us learn through homework.",
                "A super helpful course. Jesse was one of the most understanding professors I've had. He helped beyond class, he gave me tips on finding internships and lab work. He was super understanding when we needed extra help.",
                "Learning how to code, different structures used in coding.",
                "The course challenges you with the projects that it's giving.",
                "You'll learn C++. I thought it would be worse, but it was actually not that bad. Start the homework early.",
                "You learn the basics of programming in C++. The homework are difficult and require a lot of time in office hours but the tests are straight forward and if you know the basics you will do fine.",
                "I wasn't able to learn well with this professor. I couldn't follow the lectures at all. The HW and labs were more instructional, and I was only able to do them because of previous programming experience. The HW takes a while to debug but overall an OK course. Try to take with a different professor. Midterm and final were reasonable and not too much of your grade."

                "EECS 211 is not an easy class coming from a background without any programming experience. Professor Sood does a good job of breaking down the content in slides and then applying it in the homework programs, which makes learning the content fairly straightforward as long as you put in the time. Lectures are definitely difficult to stay engaged in, but that's just the nature of CS lectures.",
                "This course is definitely more challenging than EECS 111, but I wouldn't say it's too hard. Sara is great, as usual. Some of the assignments were a bit frustrating but going to office hours definitely helped.",
                "This course is a great course to learn computer programming and teaches many relevant skills",
                "difficult",
                "This class was hard. I have never been a huge fan of programming, but even though this class was hard I think I learned a lot. I don't think my grade will end up being great in this class, but the amount that I learned about programming and the confidence that I gained from the many assignments is great!",
                "Foundational",
                "Take this course from Sara if you can. She explains concepts extremely well and makes class enjoyable and interesting.",
                "READ THE HOMEWORK SHEET! the homework is super simple if you read what you are asked to do. They explain all of it. Go to office hours if you are confuse. TAKE THIS WITH SARA (Take every class you can with Sara, always.)",
                "This was a great course for learning C++, Sara does an absolutely amazing job at lectures keeping things interesting and engaging! Homeworks can take some time but are great for applying what we've learned in class.",
                "Sara is the best but the exams are definitely hard. Study far in advance if possible!",
                "The class itself is fine, it's hard to pay attention when things aren't directly correlated with the homework that we're currently working on. I would appreciate if the class was taught towards the homework more.",
                "Sara is a really good professor and as long as you get help when you need it, the class is manageable. Use the office hours and the piazza page, they are very helpful.",
                "I took 111 with Sara as well and she is an amazing lecturer and has a really good class structure that really helps you learn the material. In addition to TA's and office hours, all the resources necessary to do well in this class are there for you.",
                "This class was well taught and well structured. Highly recommend.",
                "The class was great! Sara will be one of the greatest professors you'll have when taking a cs class.",
                "I'm so glad I got to take 211 with Sara. She's probably one of the best professors you will have at Northwestern: she's fun, engaging, and knows what she's talking about. If you take 211, take it with Sara Sood!",
                "This class is clearly intended for CS majors, and given that I am an IE major with no coding experience, I did very poorly. I couldn't even spend time with TAs to better understand concepts because all my time was spent with them trying to do the homework assignments.",
                "Overall very good, I like the sequence we followed",
                "I learned a good deal about programming and memory, which is important to my chosen career of CS",
                "Hard but good to take",
                "Sara is very helpful and caring of her students. However, don't expect it to be as easy as 111. I would finish assignments in an hour, but then spend another three in office hours and debugging. Utilize the resources and pay attention in class if you haven't seen this material before.",
                "Great class! I learned a lot and Professor Sood is so amazing. I haven't met such a kind EECS professor before. She is really considerate and helpful and I can tell she wants students to learn regardless of what abilities they have coming into the class",
                "Go to office hours and attend all classes! It's not required, but reading the chapters on the book was really helpful especially after you come out of class and still confused on what is happening (which is a lot of times). Find a study buddy so you guys can popcorn questions while studying together! Was really helpful reviewing for the exam.",
                "I enjoyed this course! Sara is the best professor at NU and she makes computer science interesting. The homework can be difficult and the first exam was harder than I expected, but overall there are so many great resources like Piazza and Sara so you can always get help.",
                "I learned a ton and Sara does an amazing job of explaining topics. Office hours are incredibly helpful.",
                "Class starts of slow, but picks up pretty quick. Office hours always available tho to help",
                "This course was great. I felt that I was able to follow without much issue following EECS 111. Sara is a fantastic instructor and is very helpful when answering questions outside of class.",
                "I found it hard to focus on the lecture in class. However, the book and the peer mentor office hours were wonderful. I went every week to see Yehya, and every week he helped me learn the theory behind the assignments and I came out of the office hours with more knowledge than when I came in. Without these hours I would not have succeeded in the class.",
                "If you\u2019re interested in comes I, this is a good class to gauge your interest. Much more applicable than 111",
                "It was a good course, it didn't matter how you did the hw as long as it gives the correct result.",
                "Sara was a great teacher! Only take 211 with her",
                "Liked this course more than EECS 111. The hw assignments are fun to do; i would suggest to start doing them early. TAKE THIS COURSE WITH PROF. SARA. It's upsetting that there's no curve in this class, but it really helps you understand whether you like coding or not.",
                "This course got a little fast-paced near the end of the quarter. However, the homework programs did not really test any of the topics we learned later on, like templates, STL, streams, overloading. Also, the homework programs had a lot of provided code already filled in, which was helpful for saving time, but I wish I could practice building a program on my own for the homework. Overall, though, I learned a lot in this course, and Sara was a great professor.",
                "This class was really important in giving me a better understanding of back-end programming.",
                "The lectures are rather pointless. You need hands on learning for EECS and that just doesn't come from large lectures.",
                "HARD!! But Sarah is amazing and it is a good course",
                "Sara is the best!! This class was a step up from EECS 111. It was more focused on the details of C++. Assignments probably took me 3 or 4 hours.",
                "This class is taught really well and I there are examples for every concept learned. Sara did a great job of teaching the material.",
                "this is a challenging but really great course. I loved the assignments because they took time but were really satisfying when finished. I also am fluent in C++ now ands really understand it",
                "It was a pretty good class. Sara's great as usual and homework isnt as bad as 111. That being said there is a lot more content than 111 so don't fall behind.",
                "Sara is AMAZING she's a great teacher and definitely challenges you but makes it manageable. The assignments are usually pretty fine (like you have to sit down and focus but they're not impossible to do) but if you get stuck you can spend hours and hours trying to debug your code",
                "It's a C++ class. If you know C++ or have done a lot of programming before, then it will be very easy. Otherwise, prepare to work.",
                "Sara is the reason I took on a CS minor. She is an incredible teacher. I took her 111 in the winter and loved her teaching style. Also, she's very patient when answering questions (which she asks for often) and never makes anybody feel bad for asking repetitive questions - she'll find another way to answer it instead. The course was easy to me, not too conceptually challenging, but very fascinating for someone whose only CS background was 111. C++ is a mess of a language but it was fun to learn and super useful. Exams aren't easy, but they're straightforward. Assignments and exam expectations are all very clearly outlined and easy to understand.",
                "The course was a good way to learn C++ programming and builds upon the previous course well",
                "I felt like this course well prepared me to learn how to learn other languages, which is incredibly useful skill.",
                "Sara is just awesome. Doesn't give more work than is necessary, and in class she is great at explaining things clearly and answering questions. Also just an awesome person to get to know. Absolutely take this with Sara if you can.",
                "Sara is a fantastic professor; super helpful during office hours and willing to provide guidance on anything, from assignments to course materials to future interests/paths in computer science. This class definitely goes deeper into computer science as a discipline and field beyond programming, and I learned a lot about what computer science truly is and means at a fundamental level. This class can be a challenge at times but a worthy one without a doubt.",
                "I thought 211 was just the right level of difficulty. I had to try hard to do well and finish homework assignments, but it was rewarding.",
                "Having never done object oriented programming before and very little programming in general, I found this class to be challenging but rewarding. Definitely doable without any coding experience other than 111, but I really had to be on my stuff to keep up. Everything is given to you in order to do well, but you really have to take advantage of all of it. Sara is great too; I've only had her as a EECS lecturer so I don't have much to compare to, but she makes a huge lecture hall feel so much smaller.",
                "I loved this course! It was a bit difficult to understand, but as long as I reviewed the material right after class and on weekends, I was able to finish the homework early every week! Sara is also extremely approachable with even the seemingly dumb questions I had! This class was so much fun! I looked forward to it every other weekday!",
                "Very interesting to learn about computer science; I think I will switch my major to it.",
                "This class is the next step up after 111. While it is harder than 111, it is definitely manageable and very worthwhile. C++ is a really useful language, and the class teaches you some good general programming techniques and practices. Exams and weekly assignments are similar to what was done in 111; I took the two courses back to back with Sara and felt like it was a very logical jump from one to the other. If you've programmed in Java before, C++ will come naturally to you, especially at the beginning, though after a certain point the similarities go out the window. Also, TAKE THIS CLASS WITH SARA! SHE IS A WONDERFUL HUMAN BEING AND AN AWESOME TEACHER! Overall, would recommend, especially if you enjoyed 111.",
                "We covered a lot of computer science essentials like linked lists and pointers.",
                "EECS 211 with Sara was an excellent class. She made the content very clear in lectures, her office hours were incredibly helpful, and the homeworks were straightforward!",
                "Learning a subject useful in the real computer science world for the first time, which was nice. Assignments and class times were enjoyable to complete and attend.",
                "It was a pretty standard course with 2 midterms and a lab every week, but definitely a step up from 111 in terms of difficulty.",
                "Great class. Learn a lot of important material that prepares you very well for later courses.",
                "This is a great course. It is challenging, but it's fair and extremely interesting. Sara is absolutely incredible.",
                "This class was a lot harder than EECS111 the programs were tough and it was hard to get caught up once you fell behind. Sarah does a really good job at explaining, just something you really need to practice",
                "Sara is by far the best professor I have had at Northwestern. She explains concepts very clearly and highlights why things are important for us to learn. It is clear that she cares about her students because she is always happy to answer questions in class and is welcoming at her many office hours. Visit her even if it's just to chat! That said, 211 could be better designed as a course. The weekly programming assignments are not quite enough to get practice with concepts from class, especially those taught at the end of the quarter. As with 111, the code structure has been designed for you, and you are really just implementing small pieces. It would be nice to see projects that allow us greater creativity.",
                "The class size is very large, but Professor Sood did a great job managing class size and teaching all necessary material for exams.",
                "Tough class. Make sure you go to class and office hours. It's hard to come back.",
                "Take 211 with Sara Sood. She is a great lecturer b\u02fc she is organized and has clear examples. Not a CS major, so this class is the reason why I learned how to code at NU.",
                "Very easy if you pay attention in class, ask questions if you're confused, and do the review sheets before the midterm. This quarter there were 8 coding assignments (weekly), 2 midterms, and an extra credit assignment that make up your whole grade. Also, Sara's office hours are suuuuper helpful! (Sara is just an amazing professor in general also)",
                "It was a challenging course for me but I learnt a lot",
                "Solid class but the tests can be a bit unfair, missing one multiple choice question can drop your grade by a letter",
                "Sara is one of the best teachers at Northwestern. Her examples are very good and the course is very fair.",
                "Good",
                "You learn to code. Nuff said.",
                "You do learn the language, but it's hard to concentrate in the big lectures.",
                "I liked how the assignments gradually built upon each other. They were the best way to test if I was keeping up with the lecture material.",
                "The class explained both practical and abstract topics related to the subject very well.",
                "This is a really helpful class to learn the basics of CS and the homework assignments can be difficult but they are very helpful for learning to concepts. The tests can also be tricky bet they are very fair.",
                "Overall a good class. Sara is hands down the best EECS professor so take all the classes that you can with her. Sometimes this class could be conceptually difficult since you have to understand how programs are executed and stored in memory rather than simply writing programs without considering how the computer interprets everything. The exams aren't bad either, and it's not too hard to get a good grade in this class if you enjoy computer science and put in the work.",
                "This class is great, but it's definitely difficult if you're not comfortable programming in C++ when you come in. It's super rewarding, and I strongly suggest it if you have any interest in programming.",
                "It allowed me to know another language.",
                "EECS 211 is great with Sara. Her presentations and teaching are very helpful for learning and also the multiple in-class examples really help you understand. The programming assignments let you put what you know to practice and thus those were also really helpful. I'm not sure Unix is necessary though so I would take that out of the curriculum, but besides that it was a very helpful and insightful class.",
                "211 was great! Sara is an excellent professor and I would highly recommend taking it with her. The exams and difficult but the programs are manageable.",
                "Definitely a harder course than 111, but well organized and well taught. Lots of resources for help!",
                "Sara is a great teacher, and the assignments given really help you understand the course material.",
                "sara was great as always, much faster than 111 but go to office hours",
                "I really liked this course! Sara is great and its easy to come into after EECS 111 with her. Such a good class & lots of support outside of class.",
                "Sara is great. Big classes are hard to pay attention",
                "Sara is a great teacher and this class is great. The homeworks aren't that hard even if you're not that experienced with programming and the peer mentors are very helpful.",
                "Very happy with the course, Sood's a wonderful professor and well suited to teaching the introductory CS courses and encouraging commitment + confidence in the subject.",
                "learned a lot and challenged while succeeding",
                "The tests are kind of difficult just because writing code on a piece of paper without a computer is difficult.",
                "Take this with Sara! She's a fantastic lecturer.",
                "Great course. Taught a ton of fundamentals that are necessary for computer science. It's taught in a way that makes the material seems really accessible.",
                "Sara is a very good professor and she always teaches with examples of code which are helpful for understanding the concepts. This course (especially the homeworks) is not hard at all if you have some background coding",
                "Course is interesting and teaches you important essentials of C++ programming. Homeworks don't take more than 2 hours per week on average.",
                "A refreshing, super-applicable class after Racket (111). Sara is incredible, as I'm sure you've heard time and time again. It's easy to not want to go to class after the first midterm, especially if you've had CS experience and do well (since it's for/while loops, basics, etc), but DON'T STOP GOING TO CLASS. Homeworks get harder as the quarter progresses: start them early, because last-minute coding on a Friday night is very stressful, and debugging always takes longer than you think.",
                "Easy if you've done C++ or really any OOP before. Pointers are the only thing that were new to my former-programmer friends. Those who hadn't done any programming outside of 111 seemed to have a difficult time.",
                "Over ehh, 111 was better taught and while C++ is more useful it loses clarity when you're not apply the things you learn directly.",
                "I enjoyed how the class built on EECS 111"

The class has gotten easier than it was in the past but the weekly homeworks and peer reviews can be brutal. Leave some space open in your schedule and find a good partner before taking this class.",
                "This is by far the hardest class I have ever taken. That said, I think it is also one of the most useful+rewarding ones.",
                "There are a lot of EECS courses I have felt were unnecessarily hard and time consuming. This is NOT one of those courses. Hartline's version is hard as hell, but you will learn so much taking it that it is 100% worth taking. I genuinely feel more intelligent having taken this class and highly recommend it to anyone willing to put in the work.",
                "Hard, hard class. Jason fixed a lot of the issues now, so it's hard because algorithms are hard, and not hard because they're trying to screw us. With that said, expect to spend a lot of time on this class, because it's really difficult to do well. You will learn a lot, though, and will come out a much better computer scientist.",
                "The course was very well organized and taught exceptionally.",
                "This course is a lot of fun. You learn interesting techniques and solve many fun problems. Hartline is also a wonderful instructor. I was not a huge fan of the peer grading, though I do recognize that it probably did help people who had trouble evaluating proofs.",
                "I think we also need some courses covering some basic aspects.",

                "Jason has gotten a lot nicer this year. The class is also significantly easier than it was in past years. It's still challenging, but not unreasonably so. You should absolutely take this instead of 335: it's much more useful.",

That being said, you will get left by the wayside real quick, if you cannot keep on top of your stuff. So, put in the effort outside of just the homeworks, and you will become enlightened. 2nd Midterm and Final were much harder than 1st midterm. Professor Hartline's guides to the course materials are invaluable, and they really helped my understanding.",

I\u2019d consider myself a reasonably strong/good writer, generally speaking, but even so this course taught me multiple ways that I could refine and improve my writing, in a variety of contexts.

                "This course is a lot of reading but the plays Dr. Phillips picks are enjoyable. Two papers, a midterm and a final. The exams are very fair and she offers extra credit. She expects a lot out of the essays but definitely pushes you to improve your writing.",
                "The TAs and Professor Philips were amazing. AMAZING.",
                "As a senior who never had an interest in Shakespeare, this was the best course I've taken in college. The professor is amazing and builds a personal relationship with every student and brings out all the intricacies of Shakespeare's plays.",
                "This is an amazing course and Professor Phillips is the BEST! We cover a ton of material (it is definitely a lot of reading) but it was super worth it because of how much I learned. Also a good blend of text, films, and productions so you get a really well-rounded exposure to Shakespeare. Lectures were always incredibly engaging and made me think about the plays differently. Professor Phillips really cares about her students, too, which made the experience really enjoyable. Overall a great class, would highly recommend!",
                "I really enjoyed taking this course and reading the course texts. I would basically recommend this class to anyone. On top of all of that the instruction from both the professor and the TAs was really good.",
                "Great for learning how to read a little deeper into Shakespeare, not super difficult, good for distro",
                "A great course to take with a brilliant professor. Prof. Phillips is incredibly adept instructor and is amazingly energetic, bringing up various elements of plays while also using other materials such as movies and contemporary references to guide the course along.",
                "The class is a fair amount of work, as you have 2 papers, a mid-term exam, and final exam, as well as in-class performances and you have to be regular with the reading. The extra-credit work for the pop-culture challenge also adds a time- commitment element to the class, so it adds up.",
                "GREAT COURSE! I love shakespeare, and prof Phillips is a fantastic lecturer. She presents the material in an intteresting, engaging way, and the papers/midterm aren't very tough.",
                "This course was AMAZING. Prof. Phillips was amazing and I can't imagine taking this course without her. Her lectures were always interesting but it was important that you did the reading. Honestly this class is a lot of work and if you don't enjoy the subject or the teaching style of Prof. Phillips, then this class isn't for you. But if you do take it, know that she's amazing and the TAs are there to help you out! There are 2 papers, a midterm and a final.",
                "I had very little interest in taking this course, and ended up taking it because of a scheduling conflict. That said, I am so glad that I ended up in this class because I have learned so much and had a lot of fun. Professor Phillips is a master of making a 100+ person lecture feel like a discussion, and the TAs are brilliant. As someone who only read Shakespeare in high school, I wasn't very enthusiastic about reading Shakespeare, but Professor Phillips changed my whole outlook on the matter. This is a great class for English majors, theatre majors, or anyone who wants to become a better close reader.",
                "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN EASY DISTRO. I took this class having flown through AP and honors English classes in high school with a strong Shakespeare background. This class is by no means an easy A whatsoever or even remotely close. This class is dominated by theatre and journalism majors who really have a burning passion for Shakespeare and the professor and TA pick favorites very quickly. The TA constantly had nonsensical comments on papers (i.e. this paper is too thesis driven) then assigned subpar grades with little explanation. Papers are also fairly long (4-6 pages, 2 total). Pop quizzes are given to ensure attendance but often include extremely difficult and ambiguous questions. Exams include identifying fairly ambiguous quotes and explaining their relevance. If you explain a theme different than the theme intended, you are penalized severely. Professor Phillips is extremely passionate about the subject, but my TA was pretentious and would offer little to no help in office hours. This was the worst and most difficult class I took this quarter, and I also took intensive abstract linear algebra. TERRIBLE CLASS DO NOT TAKE.",
                "This was a great course for developing critical thinking and analyzing text. I learned a lot and Professor Phillips was great. However it was a lot of reading, about a play a week so it will take a lot of time, especially if you want to read the plays closely.",
                "This course is good for people who are very interested in English, however I would not recommend it as a distro because there is a lot of reading and it was at times difficult to keep up with. It was extremely helpful to learn about close reading and analyzing text, especially considering our essays were normally focused on a very small part of a particular play.",
                "I enjoyed the plays we read, the movies we watched, and Professor Phillip's analysis on the plays. The discussions we had in lecture were interesting, but sometimes relied too much on student participation when I wish I got to hear more from Professor Phillips.",
                "This course was a pretty good one. It was interesting and Professor Phillips is very engaging and exciting. It was just A LOT to handle, as we had to read 7 of Shakespeare's plays over the whole quarter--which is a lot, especially in the tiny-font Norton book. The plays were fun to read, though, and it was interesting to hear others' perspectives. I just think it might be better if we could read even one less play, to have more time to understand it and go a lot more in-depth.",
                "This was a truly unbelievable class. Professor Phillips is one of the most amazing lecturers I have ever had, and I could not recommend this class more highly. However, this is certainly not an easy and light work 200 level English class, so be prepared to work hard! If you like Shakespeare at all, you will LOVE this class.",
                "Professor Phillips is an absolutely incredible professor and this class was phenomenal. Very few professors make the effort to get to know their students like she does, and the class, despite being tremendously quickly paced, was an absolutely amazing time and helped me learn a ton about Shakespeare and his works. I feel like I know significantly more coming out of this class than I did going in, and I'm very tremendously happy that I took it and would recommend it to any student who is even remotely interested in Shakespeare. Again, this class moves tremendously quickly, and I would not take it with an already busy schedule, but I took it as a distribution requirement and it was by far my favorite course of the quarter.",
                "This class was a lot of work (obviously because we basically read a play a week) but in ways that I wasn't expecting too. There's a graded scene performance and the midterm\u02ffinal are ridiculous in the amount of writing they expect you to do in an hour and a half (and then they're graded harshly with no explanation as to what you did wrong). It's all way too much for a 200-level distro, and even though I liked the professor and my TA, it wasn't worth it. Don't take it unless you're a theater major who writes well and talks all the time; these people were like half the class and completely dominated lecture and discussion, so I assume they're doing well in the class.",
                "It was really fun. We got to act out scenes from different plays, and form arguments from the text. It was a great intellectually stimulating class.",
                "Very engaging and interesting way of teaching Shakespeare",
                "This class was great but not easy. It is certainly not an easy A, there are 2 essays, a midterm, and a final, and each of them are graded very harshly - maybe too harshly for an introductory course. That being said, Professor Phillips is a great teacher and really makes Shakespeare very interesting to discuss. She is adept at teaching a large group of student yet making it feel like a smaller discussion-based class. Nina was a great TA and super helpful - I would take this class if you are at all interested in Shakespeare or english classes.",
                "This is a fantastic course. Professor Phillips is an incredibly engaging, incisive, funny lecturer who gets right to the heart of each of the plays. She has very high standards and I felt pushed to put out my best work all quarter, but the classroom had a very inspiring, non-oppressive feel to it. I felt like I really grew as a reader of Shakespeare and an analytical writer this quarter. Also, I had already read four of the seven plays in high school, but Phillips examines them much more rigorously than my high school teachers ever did, so I was by no means bored. I highly, highly recommend!",
                "It was a lot of work, but forcing yourself to read all the plays and deeply analyze what is being said is a very important skill and I definitely improved in that regard.",
                "Heavy reading. Read one play a week, for the most part. Two papers and a midterm and final. There were about three pop quizzes in lecture. Overall, highly recommend the course. Was my most interesting and engaging course of the quarter. Dont think there could be a professor more thoughtful, detailed, and caring than Professor Phillips that could teach this course. Definitely not an easy course, but completely worth the time and effort.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone. Professor Phillips in such an intelligent, informed professor who makes lectures incredibly engaging. Because we read and discussed so much Shakespeare in the quarter, I quickly became so much more comfortable with the material so each consecutive play became easier to understand and analyze. This class is a lot of reading, however. We had to read a full Shakepeare play almost every week so even though I absolutely loved the class, you have to be prepared for that much Shakespeare reading every week.",
                "This course was excellent! Professor Phillips is a passionate and inspired teacher, and there was always something new and exciting to talk about in lecture. The TAs were fantastic, and I really got a lot out of discussion sections.",
                "As someone who loathes Shakespeare, I found myself pleasantly surprised at this course. I was dreading it, especially after getting a C in high school Shakespeare, but this course totally changed how I look at Shakespeare. Readings can be tedious and the midterm\u02fexam is difficult, but you can easily prepare for it by taking good notes during lecture and re-reading the plays before exams.",
                "I\u027d say it's a good freshman \"intro to college class,\" but I didn't find it very valuable as an upperclassman. The exams are about regurgitating the themes that the professor presents in class rather than presenting your own analyses, and there is a lot of memorization required that I do not find valuable. Was excited to take this course because I love Shakespeare, but I was left disillusioned.",
                "The reading is manageable but the course content is very difficult and the workload is high. The pop quizzes aren't too bad, but the essays are fairly involved (6ish pages of close analysis), and there is a section performance that is a very very difficult assignment if you're not used to memorizing and performing plays (I had to memorize about 50 lines). The midterm exam is difficult but manageable if you just read the plays, and they can't be easily bypassed by reading summaries. In addition to the pop quizzes, midterm, and first essay, there is both a final essay and a final exam, which really feels like way too much work for a distro. A lot of students in the class were theater kids and really seemed to enjoy it, but it's not that way if you have very little interest in Shakespeare. I had trouble keeping up with the lectures, but that's really mostly because I was uninterested in the subject. But I think Suzy is a good lecturer, and she has enthusiasm for the subject, so I can see why students who like the subject would enjoy the lectures. To recap, this class has three pop quizzes, two essays, two exams, and a performance. None of these assignments is easy. I would not recommend this class unless you have a strong interest in theater or Shakespeare, and I would not recommend it to people in STEM who are doing this for the distro. There are much easier distros out there. One final thing: the class is very geared toward freshmen, and the vast majority of students are freshmen.",
                "This course is extremely well taught. Both the professor and the TAs are unbelievably passionate and knowledgeable. Every class is a combination of lecture, discussion, close reading, performances, film viewings, trivia and more, which always keeps it exciting. Expectations are high, but the material and its presentation are exemplary.",
                "Definitely more time consuming than some other English classes. Professor Phillips is a great professor though and if you keep up with the reading (unlike me) you'll be fine",
                "I absolutely loved this class, it was a lot of work, but none of it was busywork, Phillips and the TAs really want to make sure you learn as much as you can and are very passionate about the topics.",
                "Kinda annoying course, although professor genuinely cares.",
                "Professor Phillips is incredibly knowledgeable and so engaging. She is possibly one of the best professors I've had here so far. Shakespeare really scared me at the beginning of this quarter and her class made the material feel so much more accessible and exciting to discuss. She truly teaches the class in a way that shows how much she cares about students learning and your grade will truly affect the work you've put in. It's by no means easy, but if you show up to lecture and read the plays, you will gain so much from this course and feel challenged as well as supported!!",
                "Professor Phillips is the nicest human being. Taking a class with her is a must.",
                "We covered plays in different mediums, through live performance, reading, and media, which I think is important for grasping how the Bard's work can be interpreted. Overall the course is great, covering so much in so short a time that it's impossible to feel like you haven't learned anything.",
                "The course was interesting, but the requirements of watching a movie and reading a play every week take more time than expected.",
                "This course is really interesting, but requires a lot of out of class time because of all the reading. You read one play per week, and because of the nature of the exams, you really have to read the real plays.",
                "Not an intro course. Extensive reading every single week and pop quizzes. TA also was extremely unhelpful. Exams were a poor measure of what we learned",
                "This is a really worthwhile class. Phillips has a passion for Shakespeare, and it comes through in her fascinating and thought-provoking lectures. Grading isn't incredibly easy, but Phillips and her TAs clearly want students to succeed. The course isn't a huge time investment, and it's fairly easy to do well if one reads the plays by the time one is supposed to. Definitely a great class to take for prospective majors or otherwise.",
                "It was an interesting class to fill a distro without being burdensome",
                "Professor Phillips is one of the most brilliant teachers I have ever encountered. The way she engages with her students on not only an intellectual but a personal level is incredible. She knew every one of the 100ish students' names by the end of the first week. She took the passion I already harbored for Shakespeare and his works and amplified it by introducing whole new ways of thinking about texts I may already have read. I cannot stress enough that everyone even remotely interested in Shakespeare should undoubtedly and immediately try to fit it into their schedule next fall. One of a kind.",
                "The class was fine. Although, if I could go back, I would not take it. I did not like the lecturing style of Prof. Phillips. It constantly felt as if we were in a high school lecture. It was a huge lecture, yet most of class was spent as if it were a discussion. It became hard to follow, and tiresome.",
                "Everything Susie Phillips says is enlightening.",
                "I loved this class. I improved my argumentative writing and close reading skills. In addition, I got to learn a lot about Shakespeare's works in a very engaging setting! You get the grades you deserve in this class. You get out of this class what you put into it. Solid class overall.",
                "I thought the course was overall interesting and enjoyable. You have to read a lot of plays, but the pacing of the course made it bearable, and there were opportunities to catch up. Overall the papers were interesting and the tests fair.",
                "It is jam packed with theatre majors, so the curve is not that good. As a comms major, it was sometimes overwhelming because the theatre kids always try to be above and beyond during lecture, so be prepared for that. You only write 2 major papers, which is not bad at all as long as you do the readings. The mid terms and finals are hard in that you really have to close read each of the texts and actually watch the movies on your own time.",
                "As a junior, it can be easy to feel jaded in big lectures, but this was honestly one of my favorite courses I have taken at NU. I really have a new appreciation for Shakespeare's plays, and Phillips is so so smart, caring and an overall awesome professor! Take this class!",
                "This course pushed my analysis and required that I become a more focused writer. Much of the readings were readings of Shakespeare's Plays with little extraneous material, which made the outside reading requirement relatively low. Both Professor Phillips and my TA were extremely helpful and presented interesting interpretations of the plays.",
                "I loved the plays and enjoyed listening to her analysis, but the exams and papers were incredibly difficult and we were not prepared for them. The midterms had no review material or study guides, yet had incredibly specific rubrics and were largely based on memorization or details not emphasized in class.",
                "Professor Philips is SO FANTASTIC! This was by far the best class I took this quarter, and probably one of the best I'll ever take. Her lectures encouraged me to think about the plays and to participate in class (she remembered everyone's names after week 2), and hugely added to my reading and interpretation of the plays. When you learn Shakespeare, you learn about all of literature, and as the weeks went by, I really came to a much deeper understanding of the themes and writing of his plays. Professor Phillips is incredibly charismatic, and manages to inspire students by making the themes of 400 year old plays freshly original and relevant to our time. This is definitely a hard class, with tons of reading and writing (especially in exams), but I was very motivated by the lectures to improve over the course. Don't take this if you're swamped with all of your other classes (do it right) of if you're not interested in Shakespeare and the process of reading and analyzing it, but this is an absolutely amazing lecture and is very rewarding. SO GOOD!",
                "At the beginning of the course, I was definitely bogged down by the reading. I was trying to understand every little thing about every play, which slowed me down significantly. But, once I got a feel for what the professor was looking for, I began to enjoy the course a lot more. Professor Phillips's theses in class caught me as very surprising and were fun to follow along or argue against. And although I felt a bit too nervous to speak up in lecture, discussion sections eased that tension quite a bit. My least favorite part was probably the movies; I fell asleep most of the time and my interest in Shakespeare waned because of them.",
                "This class helped develop my love and passion for reading, writing about, and above all, studying Shakespeare.",
                "This course was incredibly well-constructed and informative. Professor Phillips challenged us intellectually, while making sure that her lessons were clear and understandable. It is a large class, but she made the class environment feel small/intimate as she constantly was encouraging students to participate/speak up and contribute to her lectures. She also remembers everyone's names, which just goes to show her amazing attention to detail, and the genuine care she has for her students. She is incredibly fair regarding the difficulty of tests/homework, and grading. Incredibly fair.",
                "I had a great time. Even though it was an early class it was fun to be in as Professor Phillips lectures were always engaging. She lead the class in examining the text in new ways so that even if you had read them before, you saw a new perspective. I wish there were more graded opportunities because there were only two papers to demonstrate your growth. The reading seems like a lot at first but as the course continues you tend to get faster, and your reading more close just based on the example set by the lectures. The mid term and exam were both fair assessments of course knowledge.",
                "The professor was fantastic! Her takes on Shakespeare and her ability to deliver it clearly and entertainingly in lecture made this class amazing. The TAs were also particularly good (a/o to Harris) and helped a lot.",
                "This is the BEST class at Northwestern, Susan Phillips is a magical woman and truly changed/grew me as a learner and shakespeare-lover. This class completely cracked open Shakespeare and made it accessible to me, which I really appreciated especially as a theater major. The discussions and lectures were crazy compelling and interesting. By about the third class Susan Phillips knew every students name in the lecture... which was about 100 kids. It was remarkable to feel how invested she was in the class and in the students and in the material. It was fun, and interesting, and fair. (Tests were hard but if you showed up and read the material they were very fair). Good stuff!",
                "I absolutely loved this course, and have never learned more about Shakespeare or his work than I did this quarter. The professor is phenomenal, and her TA's were all top-notch. For some, reading Shakespeare might be a chore, but in this class you learn to read it much like its own language and it is so much fun. Highly recommended.",
                "This class and its CTECs LIE. No one told me before taking this class how much I would regret taking it in the first place. If you are not a theater major avoid at all costs. She speaks to the class like they are freshmen in high school, and grades like they're English majors. You have to study 7 plays and get tested on random passages with no context. You write an in-class essay for the final after you already turned in a final paper. There were several classes where I left frustrated knowing I didn't have to be there at all. Take if you love raising your hand and talking for 5 minutes about Othello in front of a 150 person lecture!"

                "This is very much a class geared towards freshmen, so it was somewhat awkward taking this class as a senior for a distribution. Professor Phillips is a good lecturer, and the course looked at several works from new angles that I had not anticipated. The pacing of the course is fairly quick, and there are (unfortunately) pop quizzes, so it's important to stay on top of the readings. That said, the time requirements are not too bad, so it's a good course for a distribution requirement.",
                "This is definitely not an easy class and I am not expecting excellent grades but I still think taking this class was a right thing to do! Professor Phillips is truly the best professor ever both academic-wise and personality-wise!",
                "I loved this class; Professor Phillips is wonderful and each lecture was more interesting than the last. There is quite a bit of reading and the exams are challenging, as they involve a great deal of writing within a small timeframe.",
                "The professor is incredibly engaging and the course is great all around. Also great TAs",
                "I'm a math major and I enjoyed this course a lot. It was a distro for me, and I've had some Shakespeare experience, but that doesn't mean it was extremely easy. I was still challenged at times but it was worth it. Prof Philips is a great, great teacher; she gave so much info about the plays that helped for quizzes and papers and the midterm. She also kept it lively, not just boring lecture. There were a few reading quizzes (pretty simple), a midterm which was short answers, two papers not too long, and a final which was short answer and an essay question. Overall, the material was doable. I found sections to be good too. If you have any interest, consider taking it with Philips for sure!",
                "This is an amazing course. Intro to Shakes will make you a better reader, writer, and person, and the professor, Susie Phillips, is amazing.",
                "I loved this class! Prof. Susie Phillips is a dream. She preps like a whole essay worth of material for each class and hits that perfect balance between lecture and discussion (especially for a class this big)! It is a totally manageable amount of work and the number of plays we had to read was honestly way better than I thought it would be. There were a crazy amount of theater kids but I totally still knew people in the class! Def take this class",
                "It's difficult, especially with the reading and trying to keep one play straight from the other because some of the questions are applicable with a lot of plays which makes her quizzes and exams challenging. But it's a good challenge and pushed me to study and develop better habits as a student. DON'T TAKE IT if you don't pay attention to detail or like diving deep into texts and their historical significance. This is not the course for you",
                "Prof. Phillips is probably the best professor I had at Northwestern. She for sure made me a better writer, thinker, and she takes time to get to know all her students, even in a large class. Lots of work for the class, as there are papers, tests, and section, but it is worth it. Also, Matt Beeber is an amazing TA.",
                "The pace was a bit rough, and I was never 100% certain what acts and scenes she wanted us to read by what class--it averaged out to a play a week. Stay on top of the reading because there is a lot! She does give pop quizzes, but they're relatively straight forward (though sometimes if you weren't sure if you were supposed to read the whole play or just the first 3 acts, you could lose points on a quiz when it tested over the whole thing). A lot of information is thrown at you, but it is super interesting. The professor is engaging and understanding-very easy to talk to. There's not much time for the midterm or final, so write fast. Overall a great class that really digs into the text and makes you think.",
                "This class was awesome! There was a lot of reading. 2 exams and 2 papers mainly. If you are bad at keeping up on reading this may not be the best.",
                "Professor Phillips is incredibly passionate. It can be difficult to keep up at times, but the challenge pays off.",
                "Prof. Phillips is one of the greatest people I have ever met. Even if you don't like Shakespeare, take this class to get to know her and learn about life.",
                "Take this class with Susie Phillips! She is a fantastic professor and very knowledgeable about everything. This class will challenge you to closely analyze Shakespeare's texts, you will be pushed in that aspect, but a very fun and helpful English distro. ALSO TA Matt Beeber is the best, take any class that he is TAing.",
                "This class is a lot of reading, but it's never boring. Susie Phillips is WONDERFUL. Her lectures were so engaging, and she made an effort to connect with every student, despite the large class size. Take this class!",
                "Class was always super interesting. Professor Philips is amazing and brought so much energy to class every morning. You can tell she really cares about her students and class content. She also brings candy to class all the time.",
                "Take this class even if you have the slightest interest in Shakespeare! Professor Phillips is genuinely a captivating and interesting lecturer and all the TA's are wonderful. It is fast paced though, so make sure to keep up with the play readings. 10\u2f10 recommend, as this is the best class I've taken at Northwestern so far. I met close friends due to how interactive the class is, and the discussion sections were stimulating but also really enjoyable. Prof. Phillips also knew all our names by the 3rd class!",
                "I really liked the teacher's ability to address the student's thoughts but also to challenge us to point to the text and to think of the why.",
                "Professor Phillips is AMAZING. She might be the best professor I've had at Northwestern so far. The lectures are all extremely engaging, the readings are obviously interesting given that they're all Shakespeare plays and the TAs were all great. I would 100% recommend this course to anyone.",
                "I love this course. It is certainly not easy, but Professor Phillips made me look forward to coming to class everyday which is the most important part of teaching.",
                "Take this course for SUZIE. She is unbelievable and I've learned so much from her.",
                "Really, really interesting class. Professor Phillips is engaging, caring, and easily the smartest woman I've ever met. She makes an effort, even though it's a large class, to get to know a majority of her students. I would take any class she taught. 11\u2f10 recommend.",
                "As a theater minor, I wanted to learn more about literature and how it relates to performance, which this course actually does a lot of, but not too much (so if you are not into performing, that doesn't matter, it's still a great course). I learned more about how to analyze texts, and even more about what Shakespeare was trying to say with his writing, and even things that he may have no intended, but now in modern times we recognize and interpret. It gave me a whole new perspective on Shakespeare's work.",
                "My main reason for taking this class was that I wanted to read more Shakespeare, and I definitely did that! We read 7 plays throughout the year that I really enjoyed and and had really interesting classroom discussions about all of them. However, I thought the midterm and final were WAY to long, for even though I knew all of the information, I still couldn't finish in time. Still a good class to take!",
                "This course was a lot of work, but was also an enjoyable class. Lots of different components - papers, tests, performances, discussion, readings - but if you went to class and read the plays you could do fine. Great professor and TAs.",
                "Great class, definitely more work than your average 200 distro, but definitely worth it. Phillips is a very engaging lecturer, and you definitely come out of this class with more appreciation for the material.",
                "One of the most important aspects of this class that I noticed is how important it is to Professor Phillips that everyone does well on papers and the mid-term. She truly does care about each and every one of her students and reaches out to anyone who is in need of help. The lecture sometimes was a little tedious to get through since you just go through quotes about the play you are reading, but the arguments that are made by Professor Phillips in these lectures do elucidate a key characteristic of the play. The papers are oddly enjoyable. The quizzes suck, but they are not that important in the final grade so that makes up for it. The discussion sections were awesome. My TA was fun and really got us to think about the play in a different way than i had ever thought about Shakespearean plays. Cameron helped us out with anything that we needed and he read my thesis on my final paper to see if i had a strong argument, which really helped me a lot. In short, this class was spectacular because of the importance that the professor and Teacher's Assistant gives to every student, even though the material was not that exciting.",
                "Awesome class. Professor Phillips is DOPE and so is Delali. It's a LOT of reading, but it's worth it in my opinion.",
                "Professor Phillips is awesome. She's a fantastic lecturer and if you're interested in English, you need to take a class with her before you leave. The readings can be long but it isn't too brutal, and it's easy to play to catch up if you have to. Definitely take this class if you want a cool English elective.",
                "This course is fantastic if you want a nice introduction to Shakespeare with a fantastic teacher and great TAs. No previous knowledge is required, and a lot will be gained throughout the course. Grading is fair, and homework is fairly light, though there is a good amount of reading required. The midterm was very fair, and the class really helps you practice your critical thinking skills. Not to mention Susie Phillips is just a fantastic, intelligent, and very emotionally invested teacher who really just wants you to learn and become a better person. A great use of your quarter.",
                "I am so happy to have taken this class because I think it really challenged my analytical skills. Since I am a freshman, I am now interested in possibly pursuing an English major because of Intro to Shakespeare.",
                "Professor Philips has a great way of making something that could be dry in the hands of another professor vastly intriguing. The class is very fair: if you read the plays, you will do well. The papers, while challenging, were never a burden. My biggest complaint would be the time constraint the midterm and final exams put you under: there simply was not enough time for majority of the class to finish their midterms.",
                "I was a fan of the in-class discussions and thought they were an insightful companion to the texts. However, as I am not a skilled writer, I found the writing sections very stressful.",
                "A great range of Shakespeare's plays in one quarter and Prof. Phillips is an amazing lecturer. However, between the readings, watching the film versions, 2 papers, and exams, I found that the course took much more of my time than I expected."

                "Prof. Schwartz is extremely knowledgable about Paradise Lost and all of Milton's writings. Most of the class consisted of her going over all the readings, which was really helpful because Paradise Lost is incredibly dense. Overall workload wasn't too bad either, 3-page midterm paper, 8-10 final paper and a presentation during the quarter. The whole class had a very laid back feel, which wasn't what I expected going into a class about John Milton.",
                "1 midterm paper (3 pages), 1 final paper (8-10pg), 1 oral report. Not too much work, which left a lot of time to focus on the text.",
                "What you takeaway from the course is proportional to the effort you put in. Schwartz is an expert in Milton and really helps to unpack the density of Paradise Lost. Whereas I derived a lot of value from the theological explanations of MIlton's perspective, I can't say I improved a ton as a student.",
                "If you are in any way interested in reading Paradise Lost, take this class with Prof. Schwartz. She is insanely knowledgeable of Milton and his works, and also quite nice, and as a result, I found this class to be very rewarding.",
                "Reading paradise lost and understanding it and it's significance.",
                "Prof. Schwartz clearly knows a ton about Milton and has endless insights into Paradise Lost. I was a little annoyed at how often class got derailed by tangential discussions that had little to do with the text. I wish I heard more from Schwartz in class.",
                "Prof. Schwartz is super knowledgable about Milton, and she does a great job of helping you understand it. Not very many assignments other than the reading.",
                "Prof. Schwartz is very knowledgeable about Milton, but I found the class to be a bit dull. The reading schedule was uneven, starting with one book a week, but by midterm season, we had two books of Paradise Lost per week and were getting behind. Ultimately, we had some great theological discussions, but I think Schwartz is a little too close to the material for apt criticism of the work.",
                "Not too much work but very interesting class. I had no idea who Milton was prior to taking this class and he\u2019s actually a super cool dude. Paradise lost was a very dense read, but the professor was super good at explaining what was important to the understanding of the book.",
                "While paradise lost is an amazing book, I did not feel that the instructor taught it in an effective way that made her students want to learn. whenever we expressed our opinions she told us they were wrong if they were not what she believed to be Milton's interpretation, and left no room for opinion.",
                "Great class if you're interested in John Milton or Renaissance literature, everything is well explained and the assignments are straightforward and not too difficult or too easy",
                "Great course, highly recommend. Grading system was fair with 2 papers and a presentation.",
                "A really wonderful class for discussing religion and the ideas presented in the Bible, but not so great if you're looking to engage with Milton's words on a literary level. A lot of the class is just listening to the professor translate that week's reading to you and then some really engaging discussion about the ideas presented in Christian ideology. Not a bad class, but definitely not what I expected.",
                "This was a good course, Paradise Lost was super interesting and the prof was really good at making us understand what was going on. She really knew the book and Milton. I wish it was a little more participation based as a lot of classes are just her talking about the chapters we had to read, which wasn't really that bad since it really helped me understand the book.",
                "Prof. Schwartz is very enthusiastic about teaching this class, but it didn't go as in-depth into literary analysis as I was hoping."

He properly preps students in filmography terms that are initially unfamiliar to us all and also encourages us to provide any sort of perspective of the films watched as assignments during class. I definitely would recommend taking a class with Professor Davis to any student interested in watching films!",
                "This was an interesting course, looking at gender and sexuality and cinematography. I learned a lot about looking at a film beyond the plot and storyline. Also just learning about how the filmmaking plays into the storyline.",

                "i loved this class. it made me think so different about the themes of gender and sexuality and also about how to watch films in general. take this class if you want to really improve your writing and have it be assessed by a professor who really gives amazing feedback and suggestions. he was a great person and professor",
                "This course was great! Professor Davis is a funny (if a bit awkward - in a good way), engaging, and excited professor who will meet his students where they are at in terms of background knowledge. Some of the films were a bit long, but overall the workload was not intense, and Professor Davis provided great feedback on every assignment.",

                "Good class that helped me learn a lot about movies and there was a lot of freedom to pick what movie you wanted to write about for your papers. The professor was also very helpful with explaining what he wanted to see in his papers.",
                "The course was very interesting, we watched movies that focused on the theme of the seminar, gender and sexuality. Some were more popular like moonlight and lady bird but others were something I probably would never have seen if not for this class. Class time consisted of discussing the movies and close scene analysis. You have to watch at least one, if not, two movies a week.",
                "Nick Davis is a phenomenal teacher. He truly cares about his students, offers valuable feedback, and organizes each lesson so that its an immersing experience for every student. Best teacher I've had at NU so far. This class is a decent amount of work (one/ two films every week and some writing assignments) but its worth it!!! IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING TAKING THIS COURSE/ ANY COURSE WITH DAVIS DO IT. I had no experience with analyzing films-I hardly even watched films- and I was pretty okay at writing, but this course has helped me gain so much.",
                "Great selection of films, Professor Davis is a great facilitator of discussion and provides really interesting background information for the films as well. And the papers were fairly interesting to write.",
                "Professor Davis seems to care and genuinely be interested in his students. However it gets to the point where participating in discussion becomes uncomfortable. He won't let people freely talk without going on a long response, commenting about what the person just said. I think he has good intentions but it makes class seem unnatural to participate in. Movies were interesting but he said he was going to focus a lot on masculinity since apparently NU students don't get offered that many classes. I think I would prefer him to start a different class on that topic because most of us hadn't taken a gender class before so I felt like he was taking other people's ideas and putting it on first year students. Rather I would've like a greater survey of movies. We didn't get to movies about women until later in the class. Overall it's a good class if you're interested in analyzing films, not just watching them for fun."

The workload was definitely manageable, and the readings were enjoyable so it didn't always feel like work. This is a really good course as a freshman seminar, as it eases you into what taking humanities classes at Northwestern is like. The papers were all extremely manageable (3 papers 3-5 pages, one final paper) and the ability to rewrite them makes you a better writer. Dr. Partridge truly cares about the material she teaches and truly cares about how her students feel in her class.",

                "I think something very important for this course is to keep up with the readings because there is a lot, and if you fall behind, it's hard to contribute to discussions. Amy's discussions are pretty engaging and did change how I viewed women's health and feminism in general.",
                "Very long lectures- would think this class is somewhat discussion centered because of the small amount of people in it, but hardly ever were there times to discuss ideas (even the readings) with others. Not only did the class not discuss the readings but a lot of the readings were never brought up even by Amy. Was kind of frustrating considering the extensiveness of some of the readings you have to do. Overall Amy is very nice and helpful if you go to her, but in class can sort of drag by because tangents occur every single class. Amy is incredible though and was very supportive and helpful for the transition into college!",
                "Overall, this is an interesting course, however, I do not feel like I learned as much about the women's health movement as I would have liked to, as often times, the content of this course was mostly geared towards fitting a specific feminist narrative, rather than considering all perspectives involved. Its an interesting topic, but is taught only looking at the feminist perspective, without actually considering the practicality of any other sides involved.",
                "Great class, very interesting material, but the professor never stopped talking. It was basically a monologue and ever so often she would ask the class a question, but no no one would answer because it would take her at least ten minutes to ask a question. We also did not discuss most of the readings that we did, which is kind of frustrating. But the material is great and the assignments are pretty fun to write.",
                "I really loved this course. The readings, films, and topics were super interesting. I liked how what we learned was connected to current issues and hot-button topics today. This class inspired me to switch my major to Gender Studies!",
                "okay course, lots of reading and papers were graded a little harder than expected. thought this class would be more of a discussion but mostly just Amy talking and a few comments from the few who usually speak in class",
                "This course wasn't too bad you have to attend every class as that is the only way you will gain any information. The lectures are pretty boring but the professor is really nice. There are 3 short papers (3-4 pages) and then one final paper. The grading is tough but you can resubmit assignments to get points back.",
                "Discussions were interesting, but sometimes prolonged to the extent I had no idea what we were even talking about anymore. You really have to focus for the whole class or else you will fall behind really easily. All the writing assignments were back loaded into the last few weeks of the class which was stressful around finals time. You really need to stay on top of your work in order to \"stay on the bus and not get crushed by the next one\"."

                "An extremely interesting and fun course to take for a distro that is a bit heavy on reading, but is not too time-consuming. The papers push you to think critically so they can be challenging, but the class prepares you very well to take on these topics.",
                "This is one of the best classes I have taken at NU. Carrillo made me smile every day. I planned on dropping this class because it doesn't fulfill any requirements for me, but every class I went to was so satisfying that I could not let myself drop it.",
                "This is a really interesting course and Professor Carillo is a good lecturer; it's somewhat challenging but overall worth it",
                "I feel like I have a comprehensive understanding of the history of human sexuality, which is awesome.",
                "This course is AWESOME- by far my favorite class I have taken at Northwestern. The material is super interesting and the professor is super cool and passionate about the topics taught in class.",
                "It was very good. I liked that my attention was grabbed in every lecture. Unfiltered",
                "Very interesting class. highly recommended. you will learn a lot about sexuality in this course. Professor carrillo fuse various perspectives and schools of thoughts together without confusing one perspective with another. contents are interesting. though you have to read a lot readings for that class, most readings are fun and even mind-blowing. good course to take if you want to see what gndr study is like",
                "The topics covered were super compelling and interesting, but sometimes the assigned reading could be way too overwhelming.",
                "The course is great and well-structured. It consists of one midterm and two essays, all of which are manageable if you review the major aspects of each sociologist you discuss in class and their respective reading assignments.",
                "The class is named Sexuality and Society, yet there was ONE reading on queer female sexuality in the entire class. Often during class Professor Carrillo (who is a great instructor) would make claims about homosexual identity or sexuality using research that exclusively talked about gay men. I found this bias and general lack of content on queer female sexuality incredibly disappointing and uncomfortable at times.",
                "weekly discussion questions can be annoying but lectures are interesting and fun. lots of reading and you have to do them. go to lectures!",
                "I found the course very interesting and relevant to modern society. I would highly recommend the course.",
                "Amazing class, Professor Carrillo was a great instructor and the course material was very interesting, work wasn't ridiculously tough but readings could be a bit dense at some points. Essays and test are manageable as long as you allocate time well.",
                "The professor absolutely ROCKED this class. It was one of the most fun and engaging classes that I have had at Northwestern. Considering it was a larger sized lecture, we still had discussions during class that helped me to keep engaged.The readings were very insightful but at the same time there were too many to keep up with.",
                "The lectures were engaging and for the most part the materials felt relevant.",
                "Carrillo is THE BEST. He truly cares that we\u2019re learning and engaged and happy. The course material is very interesting although I wish we spent more time studying sexual identities. I came away with a much deeper understanding of sexuality, but no \u201canswers\u201d because there are none. But it\u2019s definitely helped me reflect on my own sexuality and question all the scripts I\u2019ve been told my whole life. It\u2019s changed the way I think and I am so grateful. The course isn\u2019t that difficult and is truly worth it.",
                "This class is such a good elective to take! It's so so interesting and brings up aspects of sexuality I had never even thought about. Carillo is so energetic and keeps the lectures interesting.",
                "This was my first gender studies class at Northwestern. I am an engineer and I took the class because I was interested in this topic. I thought this class was really great and I enjoyed it a lot. From Professor Carrillo's general care and interest in this class to the supportive TAs, I felt this that class made me comfortable around a topic that I knew little about. I learned a lot because we covered a lot of topics. The readings can be a lot, but in class we really break them down and get the main ideas cleared up. The discussion section was sometimes boring but came in handy for reviewing for the midterm and prepping for writing the essays. In general, I think that if you are thinking of taking a gender studies class that this would be a good option.",
                "This class is great. The material keeps you engaged and Carrillo is a great lecturer and an overall wonderful and genuine human being. This class taught me so much about sexuality and the ways in which it operates in society. I'm glad I took this course. For those of you being financially conscious of courses and course materials--all you need is a clicker subscription in this class. All of the readings are online thanks to Carrillo.",
                "TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HECTOR. He's the most enthusiastic professor I've ever had, and he's the kind of professor that makes you want to go to lecture. The readings were varied and interesting, and nothing's off the table in this class and discussion. A great intro to gender and sexuality studies if you're pursuing that. Highly recommend.",
                "This is an enjoyable course, although a bit heavy on the readings. Professor Carrillo is great and watching him teach was always a joy, but some aspects of the course were a little overdone/their purpose was not clearly communicated.",
                "If you're debating taking this class then just go for it, especially if you're not a sociology/psych major. A lot to learn about sexuality (not much about sex though; if you take the class you can easily explain the difference ;) ). Carrillo is a fantastic prof, very eager to teach and amazing at explaining stuff. Also authored some of the reading you'll do in the class, which is honestly not that much (I usually did them in 1-2 hours the day before each class).",
                "I went into this class thinking that I was fairly knowledgeable about the subject, but I was surprised by how much I learned. Professor Carillo is an amazing professor, and his lectures are always very engaging and interesting. I really enjoyed the polls he conducted in class. In terms of the discussion section, I think it really varies, depending on which group you get. For the most part, I had a positive experience, but opinions can definitely become very polarized."

Lectures are interesting and Professor Norton is a very understanding, approachable guy. He wants you to enjoy the subject matter and do well.",
                "This class was really interesting and taught very well.",
                "I took this course as a last second distro, but was surprised by how interesting it was. It changed my way of thinking. It was a lot of reading and the papers were challenging but I learned a lot.",
                "A wonderful survey of issues I knew I was interested in but didn't know much in-depth about, excepting personal experience. Thoroughly enjoyed being challenged.",
                "A lot of reading, super fun interesting lectures",
                "This was a great class. It's organized really well and Professor Norton is so nice and knows how to keep lectures interesting.",
                "This class is very interesting and has a good range of interesting material and videos",
                "There was a lot more reading than I was expecting, and much of it was very dense. That said, Aaron gives really good lectures and you can often get away with reading one out of several readings for each class, or skimming all of them. Overall, there are a lot of very cool discussions about complex ideas relating to sexuality.",
                "Professor Norton is amazing. Having class with him was really fun. People had different opinions and they could voice it without feeling judged. Most of the readings were easy and really interesting.",
                "This is such an incredible course. Professor Norton is an amazing teacher and absolutely hilarious. Its not an easy A, but if you do work and pay attention, its not hard to do well.",
                "It covered a great range of topics from women's issues to racism. There was no issue the course shied away from.",
                "SUCH AN INTERESTING COURSE. Aaron is a very funny and enjoyable lecturer; lots of polls in class; fun music at the beginnings. He knows his information and relays it well. Do the readings each week, they're actually really interesting.",
                "Very interesting. Essays were tough",
                "This course was very interesting and Aaron is a great professor.",
                "This course is great. I learned a lot while still not doing much work. The professor is truly amazing - so funny and knowledgable.",
                "Professor is nice, but his exam questions are not that nice",
                "He does not fully use slides, so if u are a visual learner, it could be hard to catch up his saying",
                "General learning about gender and society, learning a lot, broadening ur perspective on world, yet quite lots of reading",
                "I took this course because I thought it was a distro BUT IT IS NOT A HISTORY DISTRO. Aaron is very funny and sweet, but he could ramble at times. We did polls which needed a clicker\u02fclicker technology which were cool. Both papers were very demanding and mentally taxing to write because of how theoretical they were. Todd was a great TA. CRAZY AMOUNT OF READINGS!!!! Some days had over 60+ pages, and there was NO WAY TO KEEP UP.",
                "A good gender studies intro. The readings are interesting but the overview of sexuality is pretty basic. If you've taken gender studies before/ are LGBT, you will spend a lot of time rolling your eyes. If not, then its a good 101",
                "This course is super interesting! The reading is relatively heavy and a little dense at times, but at other times it is super interesting and a little raunchy! My professor gave excellent lectures, so on occasion I could definitely get by without doing the reading. There is one exam, which you can definitely get a good grade on if you review powerpoints, and two 5-6 page essays.",
                "This is a great class! Aaron is hilarious and an amazing teacher! The readings are super interesting (kinda long) but usually worth it. The two papers are difficult but doable",
                "You'll learn a lot in this class if you haven't had much experience with gender studies before and it's really a lot of fun. My only complaint was that the professor has tailored the course material so that it focuses very heavily on homosexual men; while it's an interesting topic I think the class would be better served by spreading the focus out a bit",
                "Best professor that I had this quarter. Aaron makes class unbelievably fun. All the information that you need for the midterm is from the lectures but the readings are definitely helpful in providing additional details about lecture topics. Discussion sections are thought-provoking. Most material is relevant in today's society. GREAT COURSE",
                "I took this class to see if I was interested in Gender and sexuality studies and was disappointed. The vast majority of the readings\u02fcontent in the class was focused on/written by men. Professor Norton has a very roundabout lecture style. The prompts for the essays were too broad. We were asked to discuss 5 articles in a 5 page paper which made it virtually impossible to focus on a narrow specific subject and really dig deep into it while still following the prompt.",
                "So informative, Norton is an amazing professor, totally manageable amount of work, and always emotionally and intellectually engaging. Such a wonderful class.",
                "Fantastic class! Aaron is amazing and brought light to so many important topics in such a fun, friendly, and perfectly quirky manner.",
                "I was pretty interested in this class material but then after the in-class midterm which actually had to relate to all the material covered during the first half of the quarter, I lost a lot of interest in the subject, mainly because the rest of the graded assignments were essays only covering one topic. Aaron Norton is such a soft-spoken guy but he is really nice and cares about his students. Really don't have to go to a lot of the classes after the actual midterm in class.",
                "The course overall is super interesting. A really great distro especially when taught by Prof. Norton. My ideas about sexuality were constantly questioned and I was consistently intrigued by the material.",
                "Discussion section was what made this class very worthwhile for me. Though lecture was interesting, I gained so much real world understanding from my TA (V) and the other students in my section. Aaron does a great job of clearing up the reading and presents the points you need to know.",
                "This was a fantastic class! Aaron is an awesome prof, and it was a really effective survey course, considering how easily it could have become unfocused with the massive amount of content covered. It made me think more critically about gender and sexuality, and even though a lot of the topics were not new to me, I found it to be really engaging and learned tons.",
                "In my opinion, this is a great course with a great instructor and great TA's. This course really opened my eyes to the complexities of sexuality as it relates to many aspects of our society that might not always be as straightforward as it may seem. Though some readings were quite long and some of them slightly difficult to grasp at first, Aaron and the TA's really help break it down into simpler terms. Highly recommend this class.",
                "This class really put me out of my comfort zone bc I've never taken a class on this topic before. A lot of reading but not entirely necessary that you do it. In class midterm and two take home essays. If you take this class be ready to feel uncomfortable!",
                "This course was such an eye-opening experience and it was funny and genuine and practical. Aaron Norton is an amazing professor",
                "This course was great! It was always interesting, and Aaron is really invested in the students and making class engaging. You learn a lot about modern issues while still learning about things you didn't know about before. The readings can be a bit long but they're usually interesting.",
                "I really enjoyed this class. I felt like Aaron was able to keep it fresh and keep things current. If something happened over the weekend that would relate to something we learned or are learning, he\u027d include it in the next lecture. Definitely a class worth taking if you're interested in learning about multiple forms of sexuality in our own society and societies around the world.",
                "Interesting, low-stress introductory course on sexuality and its interactions with sociology. As an LGBT student I came in having a deeper and different perspective because of my identity which likely left me to get less out of the class than others might have. Still the class had some interesting readings and discussions were informative on hearing about the experiences of others.",
                "The course was super interesting but at times a little too wishy washy for me.",
                "Professor Norton is a wonderful teacher and is very excited and open about the topics in Sexuality in Society. The class looks at a wide range of communities and theoretical frameworks, all of which were presented with engaging articles and lectures.",
                "Prof. Norton is amazing. He provides great readings and explains them very well. He was so fun and a great Prof. to have. Very good teacher as well.",
                "The instruction in this class was always engaging and broke down the readings without over-simplifying.",
                "This course is awesome. It introduced me to more ideas about sexuality in general and how people work in general and the importance of sex in people's lives. The professor is so nice, supportive, and his jokes are pretty good. It was a pleasure to take that class and learn about something that's considered so taboo. I'm sad it's over.",
                "I really enjoyed Prof. Norton's lectures -- he was engaging and thought-provoking, which made me happy to attend the larger courses. The midterm was fair, and the essays allowed deeper engagement with material, so I liked the assessment methods in the course.",
                "Aaron was an incredible professor! This course wasn't too hard, with a discussion section, midterm, and two essays (one of the essays was the final). It was also super interesting.",
                "This course is great! Very interesting content and taught by a very fun professor. I actually enjoyed writing the essays and doing the reading",
                "fantastic course with a great professor. Norton is such a nice person and makes most of the lectures really interesting. readings and class material are all super interesting, a few of the readings were a bit long. midterm is pretty easy and only two essays, which aren't graded too hard.",
                "I thought that the breadth of topics that we covered through different texts provided a comprehensive view of the subject and I found the readings interesting to read. Additionally the papers for this class felt easy to write due to the wealth of information I gained from the course."

                "I absolutely loved this seminar-style course. The readings were, for the most part, super engaging and interesting. I would 100% recommend this course. Professor Stokes is the coolest and is also considerate about students' needs. She is always willing to help and responds quickly to emails.",
                "Well... The other options for the \"Historical Studies\" distro made me want to pull my teeth out with my bare hands. This class wasn't awful, but I wish it were an actual history course. It\u027d definitely not; instead, it's about reading articles at home and discussing in class about their impact or something. Not what I'm interested in, sorry!",
                "Love this course so much, it was honestly v interesting. IT SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO TAKE A TRANS* HISTORY COURSE!!!!",
                "I thought his course was really good, I loved the topic and really enjoyed learning about trans identities throughout history.",
                "Trans history is not Trans studies. I don't feel that this should be in the gender studies department if the faculty is not an adjunt gender studies prof.",
                "This is such an amazing course. I absolutely adore the fact that Northwestern offers classes like this. It's so important, and this class is absolutely fascinating. Also Professor Stokes is a GEM",
                "This was such an important class for me. I hope that Northwestern continues to offer more classes about trans history and trans studies.",
                "I don't feel like I was particularly challenged or enlightened in this class, but it was definitely interesting at times and an overall enjoyable class.",
                "I enjoyed the readings focusing on queer/LGBT life in Paris, focusing on institutionally forgotten or minimised aspects of history",
                "I LOVED this course. Awesome subject matter, interesting professor, fun lectures. Workload was super manageable, my favorite class this quarter.",
                "This course helped me learn about the unspoken and important presence that trans people have had throughout history. It also clarified the terminology that is used today to describe and discuss trans issues, while also acknowledging and displaying the differences in vocabulary because of generational gaps, geography, and other factors. This was also one of the first history courses I've taken, and I was able to explore the Northwestern archives for the first time, look at primary sources, and take a gender studies topic from a historical perspective.",
                "The course was very well structured, pairing academic and historical readings with in course discussion and collaboration. Professor Stokes facilitated thought provoking instruction and did a fantastic job of tailoring the course to our class's needs. There were three short papers and a final project, that allowed for creativity in the form of an art project.",
                "While it is clear that Professor Stokes is amazing and suer knowledgable on this content, her expectations for readings to prepare for class were CRAZY. No one is able to read 100+ pages of dense text between 2 days of class. Also, I feel like I would have gotten a lot more out of the class if it would have been lecture-based instead of discussion-based. We have this amazing professor in front of us and I wanted her to just teach us the material insead of listening to classmates talk about the readings for the entire class period.",
                "This was my first history class and provided an historical approach to transgender studies. I found that the course lacked clearly articulated throughlines/themes, and it was hard to connect the readings to the scholarship we read."

                "Overall I felt that the course was not very challenging, nor very interesting. Professor D'Onofrio was very helpful and engaging.",
                "This class is the best class I've taken so far here at NU. Honestly, with all my STEM classes it was really nice to have this nice, easier class to go to. The workload is minimal, and if you're juggling Bio and Orgo in the same quarter it's a blessing. The material is really interesting too, and good for a first Linguistics class. There is an experimental requirement, but only 2 experiments (2 hours). Annette is the best! Seriously, she's so chill and an amazing professor.",
                "One of my favorite courses at NU! It's a relatively easy course, but all the material is very applicable and interesting. D'Onofrio is so engaging and approachable!",
                "interesting class but hard graders",
                "Great distro!! Annette is so cute and I loved her.",
                "This was a great class! Annette is the coolest, and she really knows her stuff. The material is very engaging and relevant to current society. After taking this class, I look at language use (mine and others') differently and I think knowledge of sociolinguistics is an important part of an education for anybody who is interested in social justice or social policy.",
                "This was a pretty easy course. There was not a lot of work, and I got to learn a lot about how language and society interact.",
                "This course is interesting because you truly understand the role of language in society and how sociolinguistic variables index certain social meanings that can explain why society has these views. It isn't too time consuming on a weekly basis with only about 50 pages of reading a week and a two-paragraph reading response every week. The linguistic analysis were interesting and something I had never done before. The Quantitative Data Analysis Assignment was specifically difficult because it is the first one and you dont really know what they are looking for. The next one is on Style and is much easier. The final paper is difficult and took a very long time but overall the course was fine.",
                "This course is very interesting and Prof is really good at filling the time so, although it's a long lecture-style class, it almost never drags. I definitely recommend doing the readings over the weekend before they're due because the 5:00 deadline is easy to forget about until the day of and 30 pages is too much to cram. The class is really what you make it but Annette is engaging and is quite reasonable with the assignment expectations.",
                "Not only was this class informative, it was also a lot of fun. The class discussions were intriguing and provided a lot of perspective on language that I wouldn't have had otherwise, and the assignments helped me learn a lot about how to write research papers.",
                "The class felt more like a large discussion period with some academic material rather than a lecture, which made it super enjoyable. If you're interested in anything related to sociology and curious into how linguistics plays a role- definitely take this class. Assignments are all super doable and the 2 papers during the quarter (including the final paper) are as well.",
                "This class was great. Prof. D'Onofrio is really nice and excited to teach. This class is really easy, one paragraph reading response a week. Two midterm essays and one final essay. Interesting subject matter.",
                "I loved this course. I took this class for fun and it did not disappoint. Professor D'Onofrio is great.",
                "Really great class, interesting topics, cool professor, and great discussions about relevant topics regarding language as an identity marker for age, race, gender, orientation, social class, etc.",
                "I LOVED this class. The readings were engaging, the lectures were interesting, and the professor is great! It's eye-opening to look at how language affects society and vice versa, and I recommend this class to everyone. The projects and papers we had to do took a bit of time but were worth it because they were so cool and not ordinary research papers.",
                "I believe that the course helped me observe linguistic phenomenon in a new light, exposing me to issues that I hadn't considered before from both a linguistic and social view point. The instruction in the class was done very well, and I learned a lot from both the readings and the class lectures.",
                "Incredibly easy and still interesting. Gets repetitive, but D'Onofrio is a gem. I wouldn't take this class if she wasn't teaching it, but if she is, I\u027d say this is a fun, easy distro.",
                "A solid course. Well taught and interesting material. Workload not bad",
                "If you have any interest in linguistics take this class!! It's not a heavy workload although the projects can be time consuming. Most of the readings were enjoyable and supplemented what we talked about in class. Annette is a great professor!",
                "This course gave me a much deeper understanding of some topics I knew a little about already, and raises some very interesting points on social justice concerns.",
                "I definitely recommend this course if you are at all interested in the way people talk, because it is very cool to see a linguistic explanation of why people talk the way they do.",
                "This class was somewhat interesting and not that challenging. I thought the readings and the materials that had to do with society today were interesting, but some of the other materials were dense and boring. Overall, an easy distro that doesn't require prior knowledge on the subject.",

I do recommend this class for a distribution requirement, as it is not exactly easy, still challenging, but still easy enough to get through it without worrying to much about homework load and time needed to complete it.",
                "Was not excited to take this class as am not a math person but it was completely manageable and I feel like I learned a lot. The only annoying part of the class is that you have to turn assignments in through a computer, you can't turn in any form of hand written work and that is annoying when you have to make a ton of trees that can be very time consuming .",
                "It was an okay distro for formal studies. You have to be prepared to actually go to class and put a lot of time into the assignments, but thankfully there weren't a lot of them.",

                "Interesting course overall. I took it as a distro and enjoyed it. Masaya is a good teacher, and you don't need a book for his class which is a big plus.",
                "This class was really interesting, with a lot of cool material that will blow your mind a little bit because it's stuff you would never think about on your own. Masaya is great, and he makes lecture fun with all his bad jokes. He's also amazing at explaining things in different ways for people who don't understand them and has never-ending patience in his willingness to explain. Read the handouts he posts on Canvas BEFORE class, and everything will make much more sense; even if you don't understand it in writing, the professor will explain it and you'll be less confused because you at least primed yourself for the info.",
                "The material was interesting, but the course felt disorganized and some of the homework assignments were unreasonably hard.",
                "Although this class is interesting, I would not recommend taking it under any circumstances unless the homework format is changed. Masaya only accepts computer drawn word trees that take hours to create, even when the conceptual work is straightforward. It's an enormous waste of time on a class that I actually would have enjoyed otherwise.",
                "It was a casual and easy distribution requirement, I have gotten nothing out of it.",
                "I liked Professor Masaya, and he did his best to explain each topic to us. He would ask us repeatedly if we understood before moving on to a new topic. However, by the end of the term, everything had gotten very, very complicated, and it's really easy to make small mistakes on the homework and exam that add up to a lot of missed points. I liked the lecture, but the last two homework assignments and the exam were very difficult.",
                "not as easy as expected",
                "The content got really confusing a lot of times, and the professor was not really helpful in the class. I found self-studying via handouts and the text book more effective. It was good to have all the assignments taken home, but they were extremely time-consuming and emotionally exhausting.",
                "tree diagrams are awful but this class is pretty cool. Masaya is super cool and a great professor. the English language is trippy, y\u027all.",
                "The course only gets challenging towards the end -- the last homework assignment (before the final) took me nearly 10 hours, but most others took me closer to 3 or 4. The most time-filling part of this class is making all those trees. The subject is not inherently interesting, but Yoshida is engaging and it fills a distribution requirement.",
                "It seems really easy for the first half of the quarter, but the last homework and the final are pretty difficult. Masaya is a fun teacher, but so much of the class is spent answering student questions that aren't that helpful. You don't have to go to all the lectures.",
                "Really interesting class, but not an easy distro at all. Take it if you think you can handle taking a more scientific approach to language, not if you're looking to improve on your English skills.",
                "I took this course as a Math/Science distro. It started off fine but then I would just get bored in class and zone out. The homeworks, although there are few, probably took me over 12 hours to complete. Each tree drawing took me 30-40 minutes to draw. The last homework was the worst. I never will use this learning in my everyday life so I am not too stressed about it.",
                "Masaya is a KOOKY guy but also a really fun lecturer. I have never been in a room of so many confused people that are also still interested in what the lecturer is saying. Except for the guy that sat in front of me every day and wrote a novel on his computer. It's not a bad plot, tbh.",
                "It was near impossible to learn anything in this class as the class time was exceptionally tedious. At first the homework was very simple and could be completed just by looking at the additional handouts, the fourth homework assignment completely out of left field and literally took me twelve hours to complete. It was also due the Saturday of thanksgiving break. I really struggled to understand the latter half of this course.",
                "I wish there would have been a book or source to reference other than a somewhat-jumbled course pack.",
                "Daunting homework assignments, but reasonable experiment requirements.",
                "If you're not a math person, this is the perfect class for a formal studies distro. 4 homework assignments, no midterm, and take home final",
                "This was an extremely frustrating course for me. This may just have been my case, but I had a very hard time understanding the concepts taught in the class. Masaya is a nice and funny professor, and maybe other students knew what they were doing, but after attending all the lectures, taking pages of notes, and attending both TA's office hours, I still had no clue what was going on and felt stressed out and frustrated while doing each homework assignment.",
                "Honestly, I forgot I was taking this class most of the time. There was so little work to do outside of class. I found most classes to be slow and got bored, but I know other people really enjoyed the pace.",
                "I learned that language highly relied on its structures. The class was more like exploring different language phenomena together than listening to a lecture.",
                "All of the assignments were take-home, including the final, which I found convenient. The online handouts were very useful in completing the homeworks but I would definitely recommend attending and taking notes during the lectures in order to get the most out of the course.",
                "I'm interested in linguistics, so I appreciated the discussions on sentence and word formation. I felt like what we were doing was solving logic puzzles the whole time, and, if that's not your thing, I\u027d take a pass on this class. Some of the concepts are difficult to grasp if you've never thought about things like \"why is language the way it is?\"",
                "I will not be taking a linguistics course again because it is really confusing and unnecessary, but I enjoyed it to an extent. Masaya is super cool and you will get lost if you don't go to lecture, so it's definitely worth coming to class.",
                "Straightforward course - there's nothing unexpected on the homework or final. Notes are given out at the start of the course and Prof goes over all of them in the lectures. Notes are good but not extensive, so go to office hours. This class is easy if you put in the effort and attend the lectures.",
                "The lectures were informative and well structured. However, I was frustrated that the material taught was not founded in concrete, current materials. This made it difficult to research\u02fexpand upon what was taught in class outside of class. Overall, a great intro class for anybody interested in linguistics.",
                "Lectures were so bad. Could not see where anything was going at all. Notes provided on canvas were virtually no help. Impossible to follow what they mean.",
                "I enjoyed this course. However, I think that had more to do with the professor than the course content and structure, and I will say that the last two homework assignments were probably the most difficult assignments I've ever done. Also please please PLEASE let students turn in tree diagrams on paper!!! I cannot say this enough: I think the homework assignments would have taken half the time if we were allowed to hand-draw tree diagrams.",
                "I thought this was a very interesting class which was extremely important for an understanding of linguistics.",
                "There were days I really enjoyed this class and felt like I was learning a lot, and there were days when I didn't like it as much and thought the instruction could have been clearer. It was a good distribution requirement that was for the most part not too hard, but I do not think I will take more linguistics classes.",
                "This course was frustrating. The instructional materials were a bit difficult to follow. The class didn't seem to follow a clear structure which made the content more difficult to understand.",
                "The class was pretty technical but, overall, you can get by on the class notes.",
                "I did not enjoy this course. I came in interested in linguistics but left hating it.",
                "Extremely interesting course - didn't know much about Linguistics beforehand but learned a lot. Masaya was a fantastic prof and him and the TAs explained key concepts well. Only a few assignments due, but they are time consuming so don't wait until the last minute. The first few weeks of the course may give you a false sense of security but there's definitely a difficulty spike around the halfway point where a lot of people wind up dropping. As long as you go to class and take notes you should be able to keep up, though.",
                "I hated this class so much. Really REALLy uninteresting like painfully boring and has no application in the real world, which they tell you at the beginning but still. Masaya is funny but unhelpful in answering questions. Always has too much going on on the board and poses questions that NEVER get answered. So boring, sososo sBORING, boring",
                "pretty interesting goes into enough depth for an intro class professor great",
                "This was a pretty solid class - a lot harder than I was expecting because apparently he had to make it not an easy A class this year, but it was okay. The lectures were all on a chalkboard/no powerpoint involved which was a bit of an adjustment but I got used to it okay, and he provided lecture packets which were clutch. I would 11\u2f10 recommend going to class because a lot of the HW questions he actually did in class. A bit boring, but Masaya was relatively entertaining when he wanted to be. The overall structure was 4 assignments and a take home final. The first two were pretty easy; the last 2 and the final were ROUGH so I would recommend starting those early and going to office hours because office hours were the only reason I did well in this class. Go to the TAs' office hours!!!!!!!",
                "There wasn't a ton of work, but the homework were difficult to complete because of how disorganized and unclear the lectures were. Meeting with TAs was helpful, but homework assignments took inordinate amounts of time because of how long it takes to make sentence trees on the computer.",
                "I had no prior knowledge about what linguistics was or how to study it, and I was hoping this class would gauge my interest in the course. The study of why grammar functions the way it does was pretty interesting, but I needed an engaging teacher to help me, and I assume, other individuals unfamiliar with the subject, with the material. I did not get that - I can tell the professor understands linguistics and gets a grasp on it, but his explanations to the class were presented in a very broken and confusing manner. Oftentimes, it was not clear what he was saying or trying to explain, and I could tell the class was scared to ask clarifying questions for fear of further confusion. The only thing driving me to complete the course at the end of the quarter was to be done with the distribution requirement.",
                "A fine lecture but terrible presentation of content especially in the homework.",
                "Would not recommend this course with this instructor. He is clearly brilliant, but the topics are confusing under the best of circumstances, and his course materials are often unreadable due to their poor syntax even to the point that the written handouts give incorrect instruction. In addition, the few (very confusingly formatted and worded) assignments are graded without sufficient time or information provided for students to learn from what they got wrong.",
                "Okay so: I never went to class. Except the first day. And so honestly, yeah you can get by the quarter without going. BUT be forewarned- the lecture notes are not comprehensive at all (and a lot of times actually it has errors). So you're going to have to supplement your at home learning with videos etc. idk how I did the final but I definitely felt myself wishing I\u027d gone to class the last half of quarter and also taken good notes Bc apparently a lot of the hw/ final examples are written out in class. So is this an easy A? No freaking way (unless there is a curve). But can you get an easy A-\u02fb+ ? For sure- if you're willing to teach yourself material and GO TO OFFICE HOURS. You can't skip class and not go to OH if you want a great grade.",
                "A low stress class that does teach some nice fundamentals of setence trees.",
                "The course was alright, I just found the content extremely boring and unexciting, which made it hard for me to do well.",
                "This course started off okay. The lectures were fairly boring but I'm here for a distro credit so, no harm done there. Prof Yoshida is a funny guy, but there's only so much you can do to liven up word/sentence structure. Things started to go sideways when it came time to do the assignments. IGNORE ALL CTECS SAYING YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO LECTURE. They changed the course content to make it harder and if you blow off lecture you will be screwed six ways to Sunday. Why? Because the notes posted online have gigantic content gaps in them, and what is posted is not always the easiest thing to decipher. Simply put: everything that's due for the class is posted on day one, but you will not do well on the later assignments/the final if you fail to attend lecture. Not to mention that they will take you hours to complete. This is definitely not the easy A it apparently once was.",
                "Super interesting class, time-consuming homework.",
                "The material was relatively interesting, but the professor doesn't explain the concepts very well, and the course packets he gave out were unclear. However, the workload was fair, and as long as you keep up, you'll do fine.",
                "This course was interesting. It really helps you to think about language in a different way. If you go to the lectures, the material is all very doable and logical. The professor genuinely wants to help students understand the material and will always answer any questions you have!! This is a great class to take if you're somewhat interested in linguistics or want to learn more about how it works.",
                "The beginning of this course is easy and the first few homework were not bad at all. However, around week 6 or 7, the course got impossibly difficult and the problems that were done in class and in the notes did not match the homework problems at all.",
                "Very hard, really difficult to understand materials, unorganized, and not practical or intuitive at all. The only saving grace is Professor Masaya, he's hilarious and very smart but there is little to no support to learn the material.",
                "This class could get pretty dreary at times, but it is important to go to class and take notes because a lot of the trees he draws in class are very helpful in answering the homework questions. I'm not sure how helpful recording would be. It is SOO important to stay current on the worksheets and make sure you understand them because they are basically all you need to answer homework and they are very helpful (maybe even more than the lecture) in making you understand the logical flow of arguments he uses to build up concepts. Apart from this, this class is pretty non-stressful. All your grade is just take home assignments.",

                "A very thought provoking and useful course",
                "I really enjoyed this class! never taken a linguistics but that is absolutely not necessary for this class. Erin is a great professor. Quizzes and exams are very straightforward. Lectures were not too bad. i actually enjoyed going to this class!",
                "It's a great class with an AMAZING professor, but there are some drawbacks. There are too many readings -- you can get by with just skimming them though. Realistically by the end I wasn't doing readings and just studying powerpoints. That seemed sufficient for at least a B+\u02fa-. It helps to just have a basic understanding of prejudice before (like from PA training or something). The format is one midterm exam, one final exam, two research briefs (Like 4-5 page essays), and two quizzes. You also have to submit reaction thoughts before every class which is ljust a short comment on the reading with a question or two",
                "TAKE THIS CLASS. Grading is super fair, if you put in minimal effort and study a little, it's very easy to get an A. Also, the material is super interesting, and i'm even considering a minor in linguistics now. Highly recommend this class to everyone",
                "This class had some cool topics so I thought it was fine",
                "Literally easiest A I've ever gotten--never did reading or homework and aced stuff",
                "Learned a lot about language and language use in general.",
                "The things I learned in this class were very applicable to the real world. The readings can be a lot but can be skimmed for sure. The tests are very fair and clear. The research briefs were interesting to write, and did not take that long to do. I really enjoyed this course! Prof Leddon is amazing too!",
                "This is a really good class to take, especially as a distro. Professor Leddon is really enthusiastic and the actual content of the lectures is interesting and the workload is definitely manageable.",
                "Professor Leddon is great! She puts a lot of information on the lecture slides so if you miss class it's not a big deal, but class is interesting and going definitely makes it easy to do well on the exams! Great distro.",
                "This class is an incredibly easy, low-time commitment distro\u02felective. Prof. Leddon is very helpful and engaging, and the class material is thought provoking and interesting. This is a great class.",
                "This class is boring but really easy. You don't have to do the reading or even really come to class, all she does is read off the powerpoints word for word and she posts the powerpoints online- so if you just study those you're fine. Take Ling 220 Language and Society with Annette D'Onofrio for a much more interesting and engaging course of similar material.",
                "Great class! Super interesting. Not a cake walk, but if you do the readings and go to class you'll do well. Professor Leddon is incredibly knowledgeable on the topic, passionate about what she teaches, and really wants students to enjoy and do well in the class. Highly recommend.",
                "I wanted to learn about the power of words in perpetuating inequality, and the course provided some insight into this, especially in areas that I had never even considered a possible source of contention",
                "Easy class but a lot of reading",
                "What I was most interested in was learning how much of an impact language has in society. People always think of prejudice in race and religion, but there is also prejudice in language.",
                "This class is rather basic, and the texts are informational, so it can be rather pedantic as opposed to having interesting discussion. VERY easy to do well, but the exams take themselves too seriously.",
                "Professor Leddon did a great job at teaching us the basics of linguistics and how the topic we are learning can be applied to our everyday lives. She is genuinely concerned with how each of her students are doing and makes an effort to remember our names. She is by far the most approachable professor I have met and I would love to take another course with her. Her exams are fair and not challenging at all if you attend her lectures and review her slides. Overall, this was a great class that definitely made an impact on my college career and life.",
                "Amazing and interesting class. The second half of the quarter is a little more technical...",
                "Great class! Professor Leddon is very engaging and uses relevant examples. The materials were helpful for my understanding. The exams and quizzes are pretty straightforward - if you come to lecture, pay attention, and review the slides you'll probably do pretty well",
                "A great distribution requirement -- it will teach you to become socially aware of how language affects different aspects of everyday life.",
                "Class materials are interesting, but it seems the evaluation methods are rather bad. The two exams and quizzes became \"memorization of slides\" instead of grasping the material and build up on them. Perhaps writing papers would be a better choice.",

He always uses class time well and is engaged with the class and his students, and following the nature of this course, gives a voice to all his students in class and also through the topics that they wish to pursue. I really enjoyed this first-year seminar.",
                "This is such a good seminar! Professor really tries to help with your writing and provides valuable feedback. Is a lot of work in the beginning but mellows out a lot around midterms season. Class could get a little boring because professor really likes to talk but honestly wasn't that bad. Definitely recommend",
                "This class was a lot more work than I expected it be. There is a lot of reading to do, several essays to write, and a decent amount of busy work. Professor Gundlach was a very good professor and very wholesome, and the class content is super interesting, but it was a decent amount of work.",
                "Lots of readings in first half of course. Second half was more writing focused. Lots of essay revision, so this is not good for anyone who like to just write the paper the night before, but expect to get better at writing. Prof clearly cares about students, but talks like he's leading some kind of group meditation with lots of flowery language (idk how else to describe it) and each class period is very structured with little room for open discussion about the material.",
                "This is hands down the best class I've taken at Northwestern. This is the first teacher I've had that actually cared about his students as well as their progress in the course. He wanted to see every student improve. If you put forth your full effort in this class, there is no doubt you will succeed. At Northwestern, I\u027d had some bad experiences with previous writing teachers, however, this teacher truly made me feel confident about my writing abilities again. I\u027d highly recommend taking this course. I learned so much about the writing process, and I can actually say that my writing improved under Professor Gundlach's guidance. Furthermore, class discussion was always stimulating. I loved how much interest Professor Gundlach showed in topics that interested each and every one of the students. This was the most enjoyable class I've taken as well as the class in which I learned the most.",
                "Great class! Really opened my eyes to college-level writing. Would definitely recommend.",
                "This is my favorite course so far!!! Prof. Gundlach is an amazing instructor and his seminar has the perfect balance between the theoretical side of voice in the beginning of the class and the voice that you want to explore as a writer taking a linguistics class. You get so much freedom with your essays and can pursue whatever excites you the most! The class environment is very friendly as well. I strongly recommend this course, even if you are not super interested in linguistics. What you will get out of the class experience depends entirely on you and Prof. Gundlach is only going to help you figure out what you want to write about and what will work best for you as a writer. I just loved the class.",
                "This seminar was very interesting and wasn't too much work. Also, Prof. Gundlach is a great teacher and is really good at making students better writers. Regardless of your current writing ability, he will work with you in conferences and in class in order to give you the tools to make it that much better. Highly recommend putting this one towards the top of your list.",
                "Professor Gundlach was so kind and accommodating. He's always there to help students. Offers honest feedback and advice. Really cares for the students and their growth. Learned valuable lessons regarding the writing process.",
                "Professor Gundlach was amazing. He's so genuinely enthusiastic about the subject, and really pushed students to do their best work and writing. The course is more writing focused, with a nice amount of linguistics thrown in, but it's really interesting regardless. P. Gundlach is super understanding, and wants students to succeed. You have to put work into this class, but he makes it very enjoyable to do so. Overall, a very rewarding course.",
                "This course is a pretty basic first-year seminar. It mainly consists of readings, class discussions and essay writing. Professor Gundlach is incredibly nice and obviously very passionate about what he teaches. The classes might get a bit dull as the professor is very soft-spoken, but overall the class was pretty nice.",
                "This was one of my favorite courses at NU. Professor Gundlach is wonderful\u2014he really engaged the class in discussions and was available and accessible for questions and essay writing guidance outside of class. The class has four essay assignments, culminating in a self-driven research paper on a topic of your choice. Because of the research and writing experience in this course, I feel well-equipped and confident to go on and pursue research papers in othe classes. The subject matter is also fascinating and very far-reaching\u2014you\u2019d be surprised how much applies to the human voice (music, writing, creativity, artificial intelligence, doctor-patient relationships, and more!). I loved this class!",
                "This was a very interesting course where I got to take control on what I wanted to learn about and become a better writer. Professor Gundlach is one of the nicest teachers I've ever had and made the class both valuable and interesting"

                "To be honest I didn't love the professor at first. The pace of this class is pretty slow - it's kind of frustrating when the professor spends fifty (50) minutes on the first day of class going over the syllabus. That being said, she was really, really clear about expectations, which I guess is nice. I liked the discussions we had every Thursday, but I also felt like we weren't covering as much material as I had hoped to because of that. There really wasn't that much work for this class. We had a group final, which I thought would be terrible but ended up being a fantastic experience. The professor grew on me over time. She's really great at facilitating discussion and answering questions, and her lectures are really engaging (most of them). Also her fashion sense is A+ on point all the time. A really interesting class!"

Sometimes the class periods could get a little long and repetitive, but that is just because it was a 3 hour class. Overall I feel like I learned a lot. Mindy was GREAT and seemed really excited about the material and was super helpful.",

She really cares about her students and makes sure that everyone understands the material. I learned so much in this class. The three hours goes by quickly and she often lets students out early. I really enhanced my critical thinking skills and learned how to apply frameworks and theories to analyze and diagnose content from business cases. Truly, one of the most applicable classes I have ever taken.",
                "This class was amazing. Mindy is such an enthusiastic instructor and the material was very interesting.",

                "This course is pretty difficult. The TA makes or breaks your grade because he/she grades the weekly assignments. The final group paper and presentation isn't that bad though. Also the class is 3 hours which really drags on. It's hard to stay focused in the class. Only take this course if you have to.",
                "Good class. Professor Douthit is great take it with her!!! The course consists of weekly papers (2-3 pages) that incorporates the theme from the week, a midterm paper (6 pages) and group final paper. Professor Douthit is great and she makes the 3 hours go by pretty fast.",
                "I really enjoyed the writing assignments due each week. Professor Douthit is amazing and I really learned a lot from her teaching methods. I would recommend this course to anyone!",
                "I also feel that the readings mainly adressed topics that are somewhat intuitive. There was also a very very significant amount of reading each week along with a 3-5 page paper and it was hard to not just get frustrated with the amount of material to synthesize weekly. I feel that if there had been less information and less reading I could have spent more time actually working on the writing",

                "Professor Douthit is extraordinary, take this class with her!! This class really got me to see how to apply theory and frameworks to real life cases. I really enjoyed learning how to write in a new way, even though it was very different from the style that I was accustomed to from previous classes. She cultivates riveting discussions and rarely lectures, but when she does lecture, the class is still engaging. For other classes, I have felt like they were sometimes wasting my time, but I have never felt that way about this class and have always looked forward to coming to this one in particular.",

                "This course was graded fairly easily, but it was not particularly interesting as the information all seemed fairly basic. There was (literally) a reading response due the day before every single class, a quiz at the beginning of every class, an attendance grade for every class and a participation grade. This meant that we had all clearly done the readings before every class since we had to write a response paper over them and then take a quiz over them. BUT then the lectures that took the entire class were just the Professor summarizing the readings for us. AND we did not have any midterms or finals except for an independent research paper so there literally was not a reason for us to even learn this information, yet we were not allowed to use laptops in the class so the lectures felt like a pretty big waste of time. I felt like the entire point of the class was simply to get graded on random little things and never once actually facilitated learning. Only take this course to fulfill your SESP requirement if you absolutely have to as it is extremely frustrating.",
                "Interesting and good class, but pretty time consuming. There's a reading response due and an in class quiz consisting of 2-3 questions every class. Both were graded kinda harshly which actually brought down my grade a lot. Honestly, wasn't a huge fan of bethany, but the way she ran the class was stimulating and understandable.",
                "The class wasn't really what I expected. I was kind of frustrated that it seemed like the whole quarter was spent making really huge broad generalizations about various cultures and it felt kind of problematic. The course was really well organized however and easy to follow, and I liked that the final project gave us a chance to explore our own interests, and overall the outside of class assignments were not too hard either."

                "Overall, this was a great course. It is basically an introduction to consulting, so if you're interested in that career path, this is a class for you. The textbook was surprisingly interesting, and the papers were *almost* fun to write. However, the fact that class was 3 hours long (in the middle of lunch time) made it hard to focus. Oh, Mindy allows a cheat sheet for the final exam!",
                "I enjoyed this course a lot! I felt that it really helped me begin to think critically analytically about the origins of problems in organizations. The course didn't really focus much on concrete solutions, which is something that I expected it to, but I think that's fine because solutions can vary from case to case. Though we didn't cover that in class, I was not disappointed because there was so much other stuff to learn.",
                "This course was a great intro level course and Mindy is awesome!",
                "I really enjoyed this class. I think Professor Douthit did a good job trying to keep the class engaged despite some of the dry material. I also think that the team dynamic was very strong in this class.",
                "This course was not very challenging because a lot of what we learned was very intuitive. You know that all of this stuff is \"true\" or you have experienced some of it in practice, and the course just puts names and applies theories to it. A lot of reading but you don't really have to read all of it, you just have to understand the basic concepts and models which aren't hard. Two papers and one exam (where you get to use a big \"cheat sheet\"). Really easy major requirement for LOC and it is fun to work with a group the whole quarter. Love Douthit!!",
                "Weekly readings, easy reads, a couple papers, and a lot of group work.",
                "I loved that this course emphasized team work and organizations in practice. Professor Douthit was very engaging and made the class fun and practical.",
                "The course itself was pretty easy to follow and the homework was pretty sensible. Three hours is a very long time, and there isn't a ton of diversity in teaching methods, but the breaks help and it's easy information to listen to. The final project is not very challenging if you plan efficiently. Overall it's a pretty decent class.",
                "I learned a lot from the class and it made me realize that I want to continue being an LOC major! Learned a ton, wasn't too difficult but I feel like I absorbed so much information!!",
                "Mindy is an amazing professor. Pretty easy class and interesting too so highly recommend this class even though everyone has to take it at some point.",
                "very good class. you will learn a lot. mindy is the best",
                "Very interesting! Lectures are long but Douthit makes the class go by fast and she always gives us snacks! Lots of reading.",
                "The professor was great. She wanted us to succeed and showed it in every lecture and comment.",
                "Yes, yes, yes! Mindy is an amazing professor. She is prepared for class, she has real-world experience, and there was never a time when I doubted that she knew what she was doing/talking about. She is professional and treats students with respect and does a phenomenal job of facilitating discussion and challenging students to think critically. Even though this a longer class, she makes the class go by fast by using videos, presentations, activities, and group projects to keep everyone engaged. Such a wonderful class and an absolute delight.",
                "Professor Douthit is awesome. Definitely worth taking the course with her, although very introductory, she really gives you content and materials that are real-life applicable. Douthit is also a great professional resource to have and she loves helping her students in any way that she can.",
                "good class, professor mindy is great, reading notes due every week, final presentation, open note exam, and group paper",
                "GREAT CLASS! Professor Douthit is nice and knowledgable and makes class time fun and relevant to what we learn. We play games or do other activities to make the 3 hours go by faster. The actual class is not hard as long as you follow along and do the readings, and the only test is the final and you get a cheat sheet. Would highly recommend even if you aren't an LOC major.",
                "Overall a pretty good class and solid intro to organizations. Was hoping we would study the general concept of organizations but the focus was a little business-heavy rather than also looking at other types of organizations, and the course could be perceived as a crash course to consulting. Mindy is awesome and you still learn a lot about working hands-on in groups and about organizations.",
                "Professor Douthit is amazing. She delivered the material in an interesting way each class and was very clear on her expectations.",
                "I liked the course, but it was difficult at times because I felt like the professor expected everyone to understand the course readings perfectly, when we often did not. The midterm exam was much more challenging than expected and took nearly 3 hours to complete, which no one anticipated. The group project took a lot of work outside of the classroom and the grading was harsher than we expected.",
                "Great class - Douthit is awesome! Highly recommend taking the class if you have any interest in business."

I enjoyed the topics of his class very much, and feel that this will probable be the most lax course out of the music history sequence.",

The grade distribution is pretty clear, and it's definitely an almost guaranteed A- or A if you study for the quizzes. He gives you what to study for the quizzes, so make sure you study those. The worst part of this entire course is the final research paper which is 8-10 pages. Unfortunately, we didn't really get any guidance on the paper. It's only worth 15% of our grade, but still, it would have been nice to have a bit more guidance on choosing our topics or for research.

                "Good course; Talle did a good job condensing two centuries into one quarter. The readings and listenings are well-organized and make sense, there are just so many of them. Lectures were great",
                "Great professor, very interesting lectures.",
                "This definitely felt like the first year Talle taught this class (there were more than a few kinks) but he is a really great lecturer and picks interesting topics to discuss. Definitely worth taking over the other teacher.",
                "I really enjoyed this class although there is a lot of work to do. I learned a lot in this class and I enjoyed the lecture overall. It is very interesting to see how pieces that are equally famous during the time ends up differently now. Just make sure you don't fall behind on the reading.",
                "I would have liked to focus more on instrumental music rather than opera, since we did a lot of opera. I was mostly interested in the stories and the lives of the composers we come across all the time in our industries, but I found myself most concerned with the listening quizzes. I did learn a lot from listening, even with the overwhelming amount we had to do, but I still would have liked to learn more about the historical influences on certain instrumental composers.",
                "Professor Talle is an extremely passionate teacher, always trying to engage students through added humor and tangents. He truly cares about them and is always trying to improve the class structure",
                "Expect a listening and analysis course not a history course.",
                "The amount of reading and listening really is a lot, but the work you are putting in really does help you learn. If you do not put in the time, however, it is really easy to fall behind and get bad grades on quizzes. Everything that appears on quizzes and tests are things that we clearly went over or were indicated that they are things we should know about. No surprises."

We reviewed vocab and grammar during class in partner activities which was helpful in solidifying the grammar/vocab we learned from the homework assignments. We did have a quiz almost every week but I preferred that because it gave me a chance to review the information and also have more grades besides just the 2 tests, compositions, and homework.",
                "The course was a good one, in which we tried to focus on speaking the language as the best way to learn it.",

Classes do move very fast and its important to try and keep on top of vocabulary. Profesora Amorese is very enthusiastic and made coming to class enjoyable. However, I do feel that she is a pretty harsh grader compared to what my friends have said about their professors in other 101 classes.",
                "I was not looking forward to taking Spanish, but the class was still somewhat interesting because we didn't purely focus on vocab and grammar. Sometimes the homework assignments felt more like busy work, but most of them helped me be prepared for class and understand the material.",
                "First, this course is very good and I would highly recommend it to a new Spanish student. If you have any Spanish background however, it will probably be all review. Professor Amorese is very passionate about Spanish and is very good at communicating ideas, assigning relevant work, and designing tests that assess acquired skills. Quizes are frequent, but helpful in keeping the whole class at the same level.",

                "This was overall a great course. It was very introductory, but that was helpful to me since I had never taken Spanish before. The workload wasn't too much, but it was just enough for me to feel like I was actually learning valuable language skills. If you are at all considering learning Spanish, take this class, and take it with Amorese!",
                "This course required a lot of small assignments outside of class because we spent most of class speaking. We also took several quizzes throughout the quarter. We covered a lot of content in a short amount of time. It was a lot of work, but we really learned a lot. If you can, take this course with Professor Amorese. She is a tough grader, but she is very enthusiastic and made the class more fun!",

                "This was a great introductory course for starting out in the Spanish language! Professor Amorese was energetic and very helpful when any material was confusing. As long as you stay on top of the homework and take time to practice the vocabulary and grammar concepts, this class was not too hard."

The course material was very engaging and thorough, as it's a combination of modules, articles, short videos, and films. The class was very comprehensive. We discussed course material, but also had plentiful conversations and debates comparing Spain to the U.S. Reyes is a fantastic instructor who deeply cares about the subject, and she knows how to engage the class.The best part of the course are the mesas redondas. These are discussions with 4-5 classmates about the films you watch for the course (there are 2). This was a great way to practice speaking skills in a relaxed environment.",

Reyes is a fun, theatrical and encouraging professor who really wants you to succeed. The class itself is pretty easy; make sure to do the homework or you'll let your classmates down. There's no place to hide if you don't know what you're talking about.",

                "Really fun course! Not too hard, as the only work is to read the book. Tests weren't too bad, just focus on the passages discussed in class. The professor is really knowledgeable on the book. Class got dry at times since it really is just the professor lecturing for 50 minutes, and attendance is mandatory, but it's not hard at all.",
                "Professor Fernandez-Morera has a lot of knowledge on the content and DQ itself is a very interesting/humorous read. But because the class is highly reading based, it becomes very stressful if you fall behind on readings, which is easy to happen after the first midterm when the readings pick up. I would take this class if you have some time in your schedule. Overall a good class.",
                "This course is a good lesson in time-management! You only need one 1000+ page book for this class. There's a midterm, a final, and weekly discussion sections. We were allowed to take home the essay portion of the final and complete quick quote identification during the exam time. Lecture is fine. It can be a little early for some (10am) and the professor speaks softly, so you might lose focus easily, but other than that, two thumbs up. Don Quixote is extremely interesting and an easy read. Be sure to keep up with the reading guide or be ahead. It's too easy to skip one day and end up falling behind.",
                "i really liked the book, and the class is totally manageable.",
                "This class provided an overview of Don Quixote and several possible interpretations.",
                "I felt like the material and professor were really interesting but the way the class was taught didn\u2019t really reflect that.",
                "reading. so much.",
                "I was really eager to come in and learn further about a book that I've known and loved for so long, but there seemed to be little to no enthusiasm from the other students, and sometimes the professor himself.",
                "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! this class is perfect: EASY and INTERESTING. I've always wanted to read Don Quixote because its a classic and everyone should read it, but i know that if i tried to read it on my own i wouldn't have appreciated it as much as i do now that I've been taught Don Quixote in a class setting. this class is super easy and low key, only homework is reading Don Quixote and there is 1 easy midterm and a final that is mostly take home. it's clear that the professor is passionate about Cervantes' works and Don Quixote, but he is a little hard to understand. you have to go to class to succeed.",
                "GREAT class! The professor is really enthusiastic about Don Quixote and I love the book because of his insight. If you ever thought about reading Don Quixote, I would STRONGLY recommend this class because it will illuminate way more than you might have picked up on just reading by yourself.",
                "The class discussions and lectures were informative but rather dry. If you want to specifically learn about Cervantes and Don Quijote, then this is a great class, but if you are looking for a distro and have no prior interest in Don Quijote, you may want to look elsewhere."

                "Great lit class if you're interested in Latino Studies. I really enjoyed all of the pieces that were chosen for this class which helped understand latinos in the US and latino literature as a literary cannon.",
                "This class is really easy, at least the way Professor Aparicio teaches it a lot of the books are repetitive, and kind of about the same thing. TA Maria is really great, she writes extensive commentary on all of the short papers, does her best to hand these back in a timely fashion so we can apply her notes to are next paper and is a really fair grader. I think a big problem I had with Professor Aparicio was that she didn't really create an environment where people were comfortable to share their reactions to the material, especially not students who were non-Latino\u02fa. Sometimes she would respond to non-Latino\u02fa students' comments as though to suggest that they were not warranted to make observations about this literature, or that they were generalizing. Of course these kinds of comments are going to be generalizations; it is understood even of social science research that because it requires the compilation of several specific and variant cases into one analyses, the conclusions drawn are generalizations, and can contradict personal experience. I also think its inappropriate to call out specific students in the class for being Latino\u02fa, it really divides the class into people who have \"a right\" to speak on behalf of the Latinx community and the people who do not, and who therefore should not be commenting on Latino\u02fa literature. And then she wonders why nobody speaks up in class.",
                "I really enjoyed professor Aparicio's teaching style. She is very accessible to students and allows many interpretations of the text in class discussions. The timing of assignments is not ideal. We did not have a lengthy writing assignment until week 5 and then three more jammed in the last three weeks of the class followed by the final. In general, though, this is a great course, very interesting material, and not overly demanding.",
                "Take this class! I loved it. Did a lot of group work, but the readings were so manageable and so interesting. Aparicio wants to know how you feel about the readings so speak up. Only thing I did not like was how we had Canvas posts due the morning before class day, so definitely no procrastinating allowed.",
                "This is a great class to take. The work load is light however I did wish there was more group discussion so that the class doesn't get boring.",
                "Overall a great course. I was disappointed by a lack of classroom engagement at first, but it didn't take aware from the course material, which was fantastic. Aparicio is an amazing professor and she makes each class enjoyable.",
                "Amazing class. Loved the readings, the professor, and the discussions. Readings are pretty easy to keep up with and are often really interesting to read. Only four 2 page essays, weekly discussion prompts, and a final paper, so it was very manageable.",
                "This was a great course. All of the texts were interesting and Aparicio did a great job of pointing out the most important ideas of every text.",
                "class is not too hard, 4 essays and one final essay 8-10 pages, try to participate in class or you will lose a lot of points, can only miss class twice",
                "I really enjoyed this class! As a Spanish major, I will say I didn't know before that THIS CLASS IS TAUGHT IN ENGLISH! Regardless, we talked a lot about the latino\u02fa/x experience in the US and the stereotypes, myths, and realities associated with that experience. All of the poetry and novels we read were actually really interesting and enjoyable to read. We had responses to the reading due at 9 AM the days before class, which was sometimes stressful but nice because it forces you to get the homework done a few days before class. We had around four 1-2 page papers, where you analyzed the text and a final 8-10 page paper. IF YOU ARE A SPANISH MAJOR, and NOT a native Spanish speaker, it's definitely difficult to translate the discussions you have in class into a paper because apart from the responses all of your essays have to be in Spanish. Just be aware it's very doable but was definitely more difficult",
                "this class was super interesting and made me think a lot more about latinidad and what i means. i liked almost all of the texts that professor aparicio picked.",
                "The lecture was great and really stimulating. I enjoyed reading the texts because they were all very eye opening and offered a different aspect of Latino history. Even if you're not Latino you should take this course because it offers a better understanding of how Latinos have been treated in the U.S., and how literature has been affected.",
                "This was a fun and interesting course, but I felt that the prompts for the papers, which are 10% of your grade each, could have been a lot more specific and that the grading on them was a bit hard to follow, as in sometimes it felt like there was an answer that was expected."
