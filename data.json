          "Great class to take! Office hours are frequent and extremely helpful for weekly problem sets. Prof. Olds is very flexible and understanding of the students.",
          "\u2013",
          "If you take this class as a freshman be prepared to be one of the only ones",
          "I think this was a great course. I learned a lot of skills that I think I will be able to apply in the future. Professor Olds, as well as the TA, Aya, were extremely helpful. I think they genuinely wanted the students to learn which made the course much better. I would say it is important to really understand the material and not just how to apply certain statistical tests to do well in this course.",
          "The course was of average difficulty, not very hard, but do have to put in work to get a decent grade. I mostly learned from the power points the professor posted on canvas because in class the topics were taught confusingly.",
          "This course was not enjoyable. The problem sets were unnecessarily long and complicated. I spent most of the time figuring out what it wanted me to do over actually struggling with the material. I found the slides from class more helpful than the lectures. It felt as if the class was made to be difficult even though the material itself is not hard. It takes some time to understand if you have not had exposure to statistics, but material wise the class should not be as difficult as it is.",
          "Just get through this course. Write out good cheat sheets, do the problems, and go to office hours. You just need to get through it.",
          "Not the most engaging class. Class was usually the professor reading through the power point.",
          "This class is like AP Stats for the first half, then it gets a little harder. It's still an easy class if you keep up. You get a lot of cheat sheets so just make sure you put everything on there. Class is boring and she posts the powerpoints.",
          "Good class, learned a lot more than I had expected. The posted slides were great for studying purposes.",
          "Lectures would have been better if we spent more time going over examples on the board in detail rather than quickly in the slides. The slides were quite cluttered and I felt like the info could have been organized better. Exams were fair, make sure to review the homeworks and slides and organize the info throughout the quarter so your cheat sheets are ready for the exam.",
          "This course was a starting place for learning about statistical methods and hypothesis testing.",
          "This is a pretty good introduction to statistics. I also liked that it was geared toward BME subjects, rather than just generic statistics -- I think I would have been really bored otherwise. Sometimes Professor Olds gets a little disorganized\u02fconfused in class, but the class notes are always well organized, and after a while I stopped taking my own notes and just reviewed the slides after class (I could listen in class better this way). Overall a pretty decent course.",
          "This course starts out very easy (mean, median, mode), but the materials become convoluted quite quickly. The problem sets are unnecessarily long. On the exams, you get -2 points for getting true\u2ffalse questions wrong, which hurts. But Prof. Olds is a sweetheart!",
          "Pretty reasonable class, although sometimes a mess.",
          "I think statistics is a very interesting topic but this course is not well organized and confused my understanding of statistics.",
          "I realize that statistics is something that's applied in any field, so I think it's really important to be exposed to the subject and learn at least the basics of statistics. I learned a lot from this class just because i hadn't taken statistics as a class before and is a subject that I've struggled with in the past. I found the textbook used for the class to be very confusing, but was able to understand concepts with the help of the lectures.",
          "This course was fine, you get cheat sheets for exams and she posts class notes online.",
          "The slides and lectures aren't always the greatest at explaining concepts, so rereading the textbook helped me a lot.",
          "Dr. Olds and Aya Eid were very helpful in showing the process of walking through Stats problems and navigating the abnormalities between the processes. Don't do the problem sets at the last minute!",
          "This class moves very quickly and meets just three times each week. The problem sets are quite lengthy, but your exams feel like the problem sets. The bulk of learning takes place while doing the homework, but the letters on the formulas make the most sense if you go to class. Prof Olds makes it very clear what information you need to know and which formulas won't be used as frequently.",
          "This class is designed to trip up students, not to actually teach them. This class is also very frustrating in that matlab is not emphasized enough and making students do very long calculations by hand doesn't actually help them learn anything.",
          "I have no understanding as to why this course would ever be a BME major requirement.",
          "WOW. What to say about this awful miss-mash of a class. #1. Suzanne Olds, although she tries, really cannot relate any statistical knowledge to me in a way that is helpful. Let me say again, she tries. She tries really hard. But it just doesn't connect in any meaningful way. #2. I spend hours on these homeworks, struggle through them, and come out the other side no better off. #3. This class moves at a pace that is rivaled only by sprinters if you're new to stats. If you took AP Stats in high school, congratulations you're doing a lot better than the rest of us. But if you didn't, have fun in this pretty terrible class where you will most likely struggle to understand, but fail to do so anyway. Luckily, a large part of the exam is True\u2ffalse so you will still do well enough to at least get a B, in all likelihood. By the end of the 10 weeks, I think I can confidently say I understand the first 4 weeks of material. After that, not so much.",
          "The lectures are somewhat helpful in that the concepts relevant to the class are highlighted. However, the tests have questions where points are subtracted from your score for a wrong answer which is completely unfair.",
          "Yea, its good, I got an A so thats whats good, It wasnt bad",
          "I find statistics interesting but if I did not have my own interest in statistics the class would be awful. The material isn't taught well and the statistics are not adequately explained.",
          "I had never taken stats before so I was nervous about taking this course, but it really wasn't too bad. The powerpoints get really messy near the end of the quarter, which I found very frustrating when trying to study off of them. The exams are fair and Prof Olds is a wonderful person.",
          "This class is pretty easy for the most part, but the midterms have true or false that are super hard",
          "The course itself is useful and informative. Professor Olds was not always well-prepared but she cares a lot about her students which is important and helpful!",
          "Class felt very easy in the beginning but got a lot harder, especially during the final weeks. Was hard to pay attention and learn in this class.",
          "While this is a BME course, it was pretty much straight up statistics. Just the problems we were working with involved medical related issues. Tests were fair except the true\u2ffalse portion was a pain because points were taken off if you got the answer wrong to prevent people from just guessing. Class was pretty boring and people could probably get by not going to class and just reading the powerpoint notes that are posted.",
          "Good and doable course. Pretty straightforward exams. Only the true and false questions can really mess with your grade",
          "Lectures weren't really helpful, professor tries to teach material but is confusing. Problem sets are hard and take up a lot of time, if you go to office hours she is pretty helpful. Midterms were semi difficult but you get 1 cheatsheet both sides for the first midterm, 3 for the second and 6 for the final so not too heavy on memorization. Wouldn't recommend class if you have other options like the industrial engineering class."

          "Great class, Professor Olds really cares about her students! Do the problem sets, go to lectures, and make good cheat sheets and you'll do great.",
          "While I found the connections between stats and BME to be very intriguing, I often found myself learning the concepts from the slides on my own after class because it was difficult to retain the information at the speed we went during lecture.",
          "This class was unfortunately my least favorite at NU thus far. I came into the course with no knowledge of stats and did okay for the first bit, but after a while the changing standards confused me. We were explicitly told that statisticians never \"accept the null hypothesis\", but soon Professor Olds was saying \"accept the null\" and even \"fail to accept\" which confused me. This class has been taught for a number of years, but halfway through the course was when the staff finally chose to abolish penalty points for incorrect answers (-2 points vs just +0 for incorrect answers) and the slides had an average of about 2 errors per day. It just made it really hard to learn. The course was also taught primarily by powerpoint, which meant I never had enough time to write down the relevant equations.",
          "This course was very disorganized and there were a lot of mistakes, both in the lecture slides and in verbal presentations.",
          "This course is supposed to be one of the easier major requirements, but I struggled in it. You get to have 1 cheat sheet for the first midterm, 3 for the second, and 6 for the final exam. Prof. Olds is willing to meet with you outside of class so take advantage of office hours or schedule an appointment to meet with her if you are confused about the material.",
          "This class was very frustrating because much of class was doing complicated proofs that didn't help you understand the material. All you really needed was a good cheat sheet to do well",
          "The course overall is not to bad. You get cheat sheets for exams and Professor Olds listens to the students to make the course smoother. However, constant PowerPoint errors and at times not enough explanation led to a bit of stress towards the end.",
          "This a very straightforward class. I appreciate the fact that we skip over some of the theoretical statistics and focus more on practical applications. Can use many cheat sheets on the exam so there isn't a need to memorize all of the equations.",
          "This class is not bad at all, the true\u2ffalse portion of the exams was nixed after the first exam which made everything easier from there on. The exams were very fair, you get cheat sheets, fill those babies up. Lecture was sometimes unhelpful, there were sometimes a lot of errors in the class slides, but overall the slides were very thorough, you could get all the info you needed from them.",
          "I took AP statistics but this class was still very rough. The material itself wasn't that difficult but professor Olds is incredibly confusing to listen to. When students ask questions about a concept they don't understand, she gets flustered and confuses herself into agreeing with the student even though she had just stated something different. I think that my ability to do statistics has actually decreased because of all of the mistakes in the lectures. If you can take a different engineering statistics class, I recommend you do that.",
          "Start homework early it's long and hard because you don't learn any of it. Go to office hours for help on it. Easy to cram for test",
          "I likes the course but when the professor tested out knowledge there was no incentive to understand the information but instead get it correct. This stressed me out because if I got a question wrong I was more worried about my grade then the material.",
          "Fair bit of work once Prof. Olds makes the problem sets longer. Concepts aren't too challenging other than nonparametric methods, in my opinion.",
          "Overall, I was disappointed by this course. Having already taken AP Stats, I did not expect to learn much from the class. However, instead of solidifying my knowledge in this subject, the lectures in general left me more confused than before.",
          "This course wasnt horrible. Workload was fine and Olds was an okay teacher but was nice. I appreciate that she changed the true false questions upon class request. Sometimes slides had errors which was annoying.",
          "Easy class if you took AP stats. One of my easiest classes at NU, definitely the easiest McCormick class I've taken. Probably would have skipped if clicker questions weren't there.",
          "I did learn some important statistic concepts (such as p value, hypothesis testing, test statistic) but there was a lot of just employing copious formulas and the material was not presented very engagingly",
          "If you've never taken statistics before, this is the best you've got so you better read the book and not rely on lectures",
          "Dr. Olds really cares for her students and tries her best to convey the material. She is very flexible and adjusts the course for what is best for the students and I really appreciated that. While some lectures were confusing, she provides a lot of practice problems that prepare you well for the exams.",
          "Weekly problem sets sometimes would take too long to do considering how much of the grade they were worth. Exams were reasonable though and Prof Olds took into accounts students' opinions on the way they were structured. Overall, relatively easy class if you have taken stats before.",
          "Make sure to do your problem sets, and go to class. Read the book, and make good cheat sheets.",
          "it was a good course taught well. There was a lot of material thrown into the last 4 weeks of the course, more so than the first 8. If you study and do the problems the class is good!",
          "If you did well in AP stats youll be fine. Olds does a lot to make sure youll succeed, just do the problem sets and youll be ok",
          "Make sure to study the lecture slides and this class isn't that bad.",
          "Overall, this course is very good. It focuses on whether or not you conceptually understand the material rather than focusing on unnecessary memorization. Professor Olds is very approachable and helps her students a lot - she is also very reasonable and does not try to make the class too difficult.",
          "Keep yourself organized.",
          "Do your clicker questions and understand the homework. Sometimes learn on your own and be prepared for the prof to make mistakes.",
          "This course was not too challenging. Students who follow the lessons properly and attend class will do fine with very littler effort. There are a lot of formulas used, but Professor Olds is not focused on making students memorize formulas; rather, she values understanding general concepts and applying the formulas accordingly.",
          "A lot of the material is simply hypothesis testing and formulas, so it can get monotonous, but know them well because statistics is still pretty important. The book can be hard to understand sometimes with its explanations.",
          "Amazing class and valuable learning",
          "Good class -- there were some syllabus changes which were confusing, but statistics is one of the most important subjects you will study",
          "Good course overall. Learned a lot of different statistical methods that I probably won't remember except for a few really important ones.",
          "I learned about the application of statistics to Biomedical procedures\u2fdata, which was the main point of the course. If you've taken AP Statistics before, a lot of this will be intuitive. But there were some new,, more advanced things I had not learned.",
          "This course is basically a review of AP statistics with a week more of new material. It seems easy until you lose points for small things that really add up. The material is important but it taught through powerpoint slides, not notes, which makes it especially difficult to follow along."

          "The final and midterm are unlimited time and they're pretty difficult no matter how much studying you do. Hartmann is a good professor who teaches pretty well but the problem sets are difficult and take a long time. Mark Johnson on the other hand was not a very good professor and was not very helpful. He was unhelpful on Piazza and sometimes seemed rude",
          "Tough class; I recommend staying on top of the lectures instead of trying to learn it all before tests. Hartmann is great and very kind. The class requires a lot of problem solving skills, rather than just memorizing a process/info so that was challenging.",
          "Difficult but fair course. I learned a lot through being taught very difficult concepts, then reviewing them multiple times, then expecting to perform them on home works and labs. Very rigorous course, but learn so much and really cement the information.",

          "Prof. Johnson cares about his students' success and tries very hard to broaden their understandings of fluid dynamics and abilities to problem-solve, but he takes the wrong approach and alienates himself from his students instead. He needs to restrategize. The easiest flaw to fix is the outrageous speed with which he teaches, but there is more beyond that.",
          "Interesting class in the end, and teachers were very good and honest about everything. Just a hard class that requires a lot of time.",
          "This was a very challenging course but very doable if you are willing to put in the time and effort.",
          "This class is extremely difficult, but so rewarding. Prof Hartmann is one of, if not THE best lecturer I have ever had. She is incredible!! So helpful outside of class, and a truly delightful person to work with",
          "Challenging course. Prof. Hartmann really cares about her students. Wish this class was taught in a smaller sections, the big lectures make it intimidating to ask questions when you're really confused.",
          "This is a hard class. But Professor Hartmann is enthusiastic and cares about her students. The out-of-class labs are silly and didn't seem like they had too much worth, but they weren't too hard. Weekly problem sets are hard though. Especially get an early start on the homeworks for which you turn in a hard copy since you don't have the solutions available. My recommendation for the midterm and final exam is to go in with a soft time limit for yourself, and then reassess once you reach that time limit. Unlimited time for an exam can be intimidating, but I liked it. It is important to be very focused during them though.",
          "The course material was interesting but could have been aided a lot more out of class or during office hours. Coursework was intense and the homework problem sets were very difficult to manage without help. Office hours were not useful.",

          "Hard course. The paper homeworks are very difficult and took a lot of time. Prof Hartman is great and her lectures were very clear and helpful. Prof Johnson was a little intimidating and his lectures could be confusing. It was hard to have two very different teaching styles mixed.",
          "Solid course. Lectures were quite interesting. It could have been better if the class size was a bit smaller.",

          "Not fun, the hardcopy problem sets suck. Hartmann is great, Johnson is cool if you are not easily offended",
          "The professor is great and you will learn a lot but you have to put in the work. The annoying part is you will spend hours each week on problem sets but then 45% of your grade is your final so if you don't test well then its all for nothing.",
          "Very challenging course. Need to put in a lot of work to truly understand concepts. Tests are very application based so you cant just memorize specific problems you need to actually understand the concepts",
          "The class overall is a lot of work. I dont like the format of the class, in that the midterm and final are unlimited timed. The hardcopy problem sets every other week are also really hard and really time consuming. Overall, Hartmann is a great professor and genuinely cares about teaching. I didn't love the class, but i did really like her.",
          "When starting this course, I was repeatedly told it was one of the hardest in McCormick and that it would be incredibly difficult and frustrating. While I did admittedly find the course to be difficult, I also really enjoyed it. The unlimited time midterm and final exam were incredibly fair and were ones that you can definitely excel in. Weekly online homeworks weren't bad at all and were really helpful in reviewing material and preparing for exams. Labs (that were performed at home with a group) weren't too time consuming either, and they provided the opportunity to see what we were learning in class in real life examples. The only thing I would say I wasn't too fond of were the biweekly problem sets (alternating with the online assignments). It was really helpful that they could be worked on in groups, but they were quite challenging, and weeks with them were definitely more stressful than those without. That being said, they only account for 10% of the grade, and it was still totally possible to score decently on them. In terms of the professors, I thought Prof. Hartmann was incredible. She lectures very well, posts notes, provides additional practice problems, and she genuinely cares that her students are able to manage the class, even holding multiple review sessions before the final. Prof. Johnson is very knowledgable and provides excellent solutions to the problem sets during discussion, but I wouldn't say he as approachable as Prof. Hartmann. While the course does seem intimidating, I just want to add that it's surprisingly manageable (but of course requires a lot of work).",
          "Extra \"topics\" problems are helpful. DO THE ONLINE HOMEWORKS. They're formatted like exams so exams aren't as scary, especially if you treat those homeworks like little quizzes. Asking questions in class is the best way to get concepts cleared up! Posting on piazza or asking in office hours won't always get a clear answer.",
          "The professors were excellent, but also work very hard and expect the students to be able to perform at the same level. There is a lot of material, but if you work to learn it it's incredibly rewarding and the professors are very helpful.",
          "I disliked this course with a burning passion. The content is difficult, but the class is structured in such a way that students do not have a fair opportunity to learn and do well. Professor Hartmann was wonderful, and was the best part of the course. It was clear that she cared.",
          "This class is pretty rough. The weekly homework was long, but similar to the midterm\u02ffinal. The 3 at-home labs were useless and just took about 2 hours each. The professors are harsh, but willing to help. Study hard using the given materials and practice a lot.",
          "The homework was much harder than any examples given in class. Unlimited time exams are terrible because while you aren't rushing they are like doing a problem set in one sitting.",
          "Pretty terrible course. Class lectures consists of just writing down these long examples with little understanding of why we are doing it. Hartmanns handwriting is pretty bad yet she still prefers to project her writing on a piece of paper. She is a great person but she makes a lot of mistakes during class and they can be pretty hindering when you are trying to keep up with the problem while simultaneously trying to piece together what exactly she wrote five lines ago.",
          "The class is tough and the lectures are often not at the same level of difficulty as the problem sets and the tests.",
          "Material is pretty interesting and tests are fair, the class isn't too bad if you pay attention. Hartmann does a great job communicating ideas.",
          "I really enjoyed this course, it was taught in a methodical and clear matter, and I feel like I learned a lot.",
          "Difficult class but Hartman did a great job navigating the class through the material.",
          "It's a very difficult class, but a required basic engineering. Prof. Hartmann is a great lecturer, but both she and Prof. Johnson adhere (probably too strictly) to the \"figure it out on your own\" methodology, sometimes withholding information even if it means clarifying the problem.",
          "The lecture was great and Professor Hartmann really cares if students are learning and understanding. The labs were unnecessary and graded ridiculously harshly for the little instruction and direction that was given. Please give serious thought into eliminating them or revising how they are done as they added a lot of frustration to this course which would have otherwise been great.",
          "Honestly one of my favourite courses in Northwestern engineering so far. Professors were extremely intelligent about the subject and go out of their way to help you. Also one of the harder subjects, especially the hw. But its completely feasible. Great course overall.",
          "The content was not too hard to understand most of the time but Johnson and Hartman often contradicted each other between lecture and discussion so solving problems would get confusing. Johnson would never really finish solving the homework problems in discussion so I never had any idea what the final correct answer was to study for exams. There was always too much material too study and no practice exams so i never knew what to study or focus on for the midterm or final.",
          "Good course. First midterm is hard, but studying hard for the final helps. Easy to fall behind and hard to catch back up. Focusing on topics and online homeworks is key",
          "Hard class. Hard copy homeworks take numerous hours and are hard to do. professors want you to learn by struggling failing and learning from mistakes and are not very helpful in OH but you learn a lot in the end if you put in the work",
          "This class is very difficult, but if you put in the work you will succeed. Unfortunately, the amount of work you need to put in in order to succeed is far more than the amount of time you have to do it",
          "Hartmann is a great professor and is generally helpful when answering questions. Johnson, however, gives unhelpful comments on Piazza. Hartmann's lectures are good, but sometimes the constant cramming of new material gets tiring. The hard copy homeworks are also ridiculously difficult sometimes and it's super frustrating that they won't give solutions online so we can study them before the tests. Also, the final exam took between 4-8 hours to complete which was quite the struggle.",
          "A difficult course but manageable if you go to lecture and actually go through all the topics. Staying on top of the material is hard, but if you do it you wont have to cram as many different topics into such a short amount of time. Although there is no textbook, the posted lectures plus the topics gave plenty of opportunity to understand the material.",
          "Probably the most difficult class I've ever taken. You need to get a study group early and do the p sets with them if you want to know anything"

My main issue from the class was that the textbook just didn't feel completely appropriate for the subject of the course. With the current textbook and teaching style, this felt like a good freshman-level course. However, as an upperclassman, it felt a little bit easy\u2fbasic.",
          "Lecture notes were not going to be put up on canvas SO I went to basically every single lecture. They are extremely boring lectures, and you will find yourself writing down and being told the same equation over 50 times. Lectures are based exactly off of the book, but lecture does not do anything to supplement the book material. Furthermore, reading the book is more interesting\u02fengaging/understandable than lectures. You do not really learn anything new until the last two weeks of the class.",
          "Class was okay. Homework was hard - needed assistance from TA's during discussion almost every week to do it. Lecture went at a good pace. Lots of repetition to lock in concepts",
          "It was the instructors first time presenting this course so it wasn't perfect, but it was pretty well organized. Too many notes to take down made it hard to understand lecture.",
          "I enjoyed this course more than I thought I ever would and think it will prove to be very helpful in engineering applications",
          "There are a lot of parts of lecture that can be improved to help students in general. For example, the amount of writing that is expected during class makes it unable for a lot of students to comprehend what they are reading.",
          "This course was very interesting but the material was very hard. It is important to keep up with day to day lectures and lessons and make sure you understand them; otherwise, you will fall behind and will perform poorly on exams.The problem sets are meant to be very challenging but if you try to get through them yourself and give yourself enough time throughout the week to do it - and not procrastinate - it will be very much worth it in the end.",
          "Professor Kamat is a great teacher. She cares about her students and makes the class entertaining and informative.",
          "Good class, not too challenging. Final was pretty difficult though, would recommend studying well in advance for it.",
          "Professor Kamat is very kind and relatable. Do the homework, and you will be fine. Go to the discussion section for help on the homework. The TAs are very chill and helpful. For exams, you have to effectively pace yourself, because you can be very pressed for time.",
          "It was a very fair course where the homeworks were pretty hard but the test were extremely fair. Kamat was a great teacher and gave very useful notes during class. You had to go to class or else you wouldn't get good notes. The book is kinda hard to read so going to class is preferred. There is also a 2 hour discussion section where the TAs hang out to answer questions. This was super nice because I would just do my weekly homework there.",

          "At first, I thought this class was difficult and boring. It got much more interesting as the quarter went by and the problems became sort of fun to solve. I definitely recommend putting full effort into the problem sets. They are much more difficult than exams, so if you learn through the problem sets, you'll be set for the exams.",

          "This course overall was a good course. The homework took a really long time, but the discussion section was VERY VERY helpful. The midterms were reasonable; midterm one was VERY easy but midterm two was decently hard. The final was extremely hard, however. The professor is very approachable and teaches the material very well, but the final exam was definitely on a whole new level of difficulty.",

She's definitely better when she's prepared (gets a little frazzled when asked about things she wasn't prepared for), but overall she was wonderful. Second exam definitely way harder than the first, but the final was relatively fair, so (I think) it works out okay. Also, make sure to start the hw early - it's definitely VERY time consuming! Still would recommend taking this class with her though!",
          "This professor (Kamat) is young, new, and sweet, but her teaching methods are boring. Basically, just jam all the formulas onto your cheat sheet for the midterms and you'll be fine.

Overall, a good class. Thermodynamics sounds scary, but this class is not.",

          "This class is pretty easy. Its mostly just problem solving, but it is useful, and I learned a fair amount. Theres one pset a week that can take up to 8-10 hours on a bad week, but do those well and youll have no problems on the tests.",

Homework also got more applicable as the course went on- in the beginning, most of the time I spent on problem sets was dedicated to the organization of the answer page.",
          "I was really disappointed in this class. We spent the first 7 weeks learning how to solve glorified systems of equations applied to BME topics. Prof. Kamat is a clear and nice instructor, but I think the course material and homework are so useless. I don't feel like I know more about the world now, just how to deal with tedious equations.",
          "Thermo is a difficult class, and I recommend you utilize the office hours as much as possible. As far as I know, there are only three per week, two of which come in the form of a discussion section, which severely limits your options. Otherwise, you'll be left doing the homework, which has to be the most difficult weekly assignment I've seen while I've been here. Fortunately, the tests are more or less pared-down versions of the homework, which means if you understand the work you'll do fine when it counts. Still, there's going to be a lot of frustrating trial-and-error that you're going to have to prepare for in order to get through most of the class.",

The course itself is so surface level, and we spend so much time on easy algebra in the earlier part of the course. It is very disappointing that the BME department makes us take such a surface level course for an important subject. Not a good use of time at all.",

I'm not BME, I'm an environmental engineer, so I was a bit concerned that it would be too focused on human bio processes, and the class itself was not. On the other hand, the textbook problems were, and were also way too long. The homeworks were ridiculously long, often tedious. I blame this on the textbook, which offers long-format problems that just take forever to internalize. That's the worst part of this class. The tests are very fair, but watch out for time constraints. Overall this was a good course, and Professor Kamat was fantastic.",
          "This class was useful, although the text seemed to cover the material in a round-about way much of the time.",
          "The course in general isn't too bad. The weekly homeworks took a lot of time, and was really difficult. The midterms and final were all easier than the hw and tested you on if you actually knew the material, not meant to trick you. As a result, the exams are all pretty fair, but that being said, if you make a mistake on an exam, it is very hard to bounce back since the averages are all very high. Kamat is a good lecturer, but the lectures sometimes felt redundant and unorganized. It's also annoying how the course notes are not posted online so you can not go back and review notes if you do not write them down quickly during the lecture",
          "Pretty good course, homeworks will take you a very long time so try to start them early. Really commit a lot of time to them, they help you study for the exams. Exams are very fair, no real suprises but make sure to know how to do all aspects of the homework. Lecture was rather repetitive and quick (felt as if I was just endlessly copying notes down), was a little ineffective at teaching concepts, often was easier and quicker to just read the book (good textbook).",
          "Overall the course is difficult, but this is mostly due to incredibly high expectations from the professor. Homework is very difficult and it\u2019s not actually graded for completion so make sure you know her grading policies beforehand. The midterms aren\u2019t difficult content-wise but you will run out of time if you haven\u2019t done a million practice problems. Strict professor, but is easier if you do everything.",
          "The professor is very nice and wants students to do well. Homeworks were helpful but longer than necessary. Homework grading was nice that it was only 2. Class expectations or instructions were not always clear, expecially with specific homework problems. Note taking in class made learning difficult.",

Professor just copied down notes from one piece of paper to another, and then made mistakes doing so. Also, often didn't have great answers for questions. A lot of the lectures have errors in them, missing negative signs in equations etc. Example problems given in class are hard to follow and not very useful because professor just pulled out numbers and didn't say what question from the book the example was. Also, professor says that 2 homework problems are graded for accuracy while the others are graded for completion, but this isn't the case, they grade them all for accuracy which is wrong. Professor Kamat was really bad at responding to emails in which students asked questions. Also, apparently when asked about how she graded the homework versus what the syllabus said, she responded by saying they reserve the right to grade for completion, so basically when they are lazy or don't feel like grading they can make it for completion. Really fake professor, seems nice and all but isn't very helpful.",

          "This was a solid course and was more interesting than I expected. Professor Kamat was a good teacher. Tests were graded pretty harshly tho.",
          "This class was okay. The weekly homework was pretty long and tedious, however going to TA office hours is pretty helpful for doing the homework. Kamat made it clear what we needed to know, however she makes so many mistakes in lecture that you won't really understand your notes when you look back at them. Additionally, it was really weird and super annoying that she wouldn't give back our tests to us, instead we had to go look at them in her office during select times but we weren't allowed to take them out of her office. Additionally, the way the homework is graded is so stupid. On the syllabus it said that they will only grade two problems for correctness and the rest for completion, however this was basically a complete lie as a lot of students got points off for the completion problems that they had done incorrectly. Also, Kamat's office hours are Friday at 3 pm which is such a bad time because no one has started the homework by then and a lot of people have class at 3, and then the TA office hours are Friday at 3 and Monday at 2, which are also very inconvenient times.",
          "I liked the professor and her teaching style because it was very organized and direct. Her tests were not impossible, although it was a time crunch.",
          "This class is affectively a filler course for the university. There is nothing novel to the class that is learned here. It draws on the conservation of momentum and force learned in EA2, fluid dynamics via the bernouli equation which I assume we will learn in fluid dynamics the class and conservation of charge covered in Physics 135-2. It would be nice to have one more elective instead of thermodynamics which only deals with heat during weeks 6-9. Stay on top of work and it will be fine.",
          "Overall this course is not too bad. During class you get all of your notes and you must apply during the homeworks. The homeworks take time depending on the week. The problems are harder than tests and exams and they count for a good portion of your grade. It is important to understand these well because although easier, the tests are a time crunch and you have to understand the material well enough to do it fast and right the first time around. However, overall, the material is not hard to understand and apply.",

          "This class was very poorly structured because aside from the problem sets, which were extremely long and beyond what we went over in class (one time taking me almost 20 hours to complete), there was no other additional practice to review for exams and go over course material, which is the main way I am able to study and feel prepared. Hopefully in the future students will have more access to extra practice problems made by the professor or solutions to book problems.",
          "Exams were long but generally fair, homework was decently time consuming but helpful, Professor Kamat is good teacher and she teaches in a very light-hearted manner which I appreciated",
          "Dr. Kamat was always very relatable and easy to learn from. However, sometimes the homework took way too long. They aren't typically difficult problems; but with the engineering methodology that we have to follow (which I do like, since it makes sense in terms of the progression of the problem), the problems often take extended periods of time to complete. Also, I often found myself making up methods to solving problems, since they were often different from problems we look at in class, so it was often frustrating to not know what I was doing until I compared my answers to the key after the homework was due. This is especially important because the homework problems are more similar to what is on the exams in comparison to the problems done in class.",
          "Professor Kamat really cares about her students and does a good job of making the material easy to understand. Course starts off very easy but ramps up later. The problem sets are very long and difficult (so start them early and go to discussion) but the tests are very manageable.",
          "The course was interesting and well taught but the homeworks took upwards of 6-8 hours some weeks. The TAs are good about answering questions in discussion though, which was useful. The first and second midterm were not too difficult but I felt really pressed for time, while the final was better paced but a lot harder.",
          "Kinda weird course. Not a ton of material is covered, but the problem sets were absurdly long and tedious. Exams were alright if you manage your time.",
          "Took this as a basic engineering requirement for IE major; was happy to see that everything is very math-based and looks like algebra\u2fcalculus word problems. The HWs were pretty long, but not hard for the most part since lectures were very clear and easy to follow."

          "I thought that the material was important to learn, and the tests were very fair.",
          "This was a useful course. It offered the opportunity to get lots of practice with the material.",
          "Heavy on memorizing formulas/plug and chug. Prof. Rudnicki is nice a very organized instructor. There is a lot of homework, tests are fair but cover quite a bit of material.",
          "This was the most painful class I have experienced in my five quarters at northwestern. I have never encountered drier and more uninteresting material, and it didn't help that all the material was presented in the most confusing way possible. There were daily mastering homeworks, which were a ridiculous amount of work to assign on a daily basis. Mastering homeworks were also consistently too specific, or covered material before we covered it in class. Lectures were entirely not engaging, and a lot of the times the derivations weren't even relevant to being successful in the course. While the homework assignments and tests were relatively fair, it was still an awful class, not relevant to anyone who doesn't want to build bridges as a career.",
          "Professor Rudnicki is very good. The midterms and final are very straightforward with no tick questions.",
          "This course has an absurd amount of homework, be it the online daily mastering engineering problems, weekly labs, and weekly paper homework.",
          "God this class sucks. Don't go. Buy a Chegg account and call it a day. You'll pass don't worry.",
          "I hated this class. It was so painfully boring it hurt. It hasnt been updated in about 20 something years.",
          "Do-able basic engineering elective, builds on the concepts of EA2. Only 4 labs, and they go by really quickly but the reports can be a real pain. Mastering Engineering homework due every week day so you need to buy a subscription and there's a written problem set due at the end of the week. You absolutely do not need the textbook because all the HW problems are posted on Canvas. No cheat sheets or formula sheets are allowed or even provided on the exams which really sucks.",
          "You have to spend a lot of time on this class to understand it and the BME breakout session sucks and is an extreme amount of time and effort that is useless which is a bummer because that was the part of the class i was most excited for",
          "This is your average basic engineering course. Sometimes very very frustrating, and nothing special. Prof. Rudicki's notes and teaching could be a little clearer.",
          "This class covered topics and materials very similar to those covered in EA 2. I thought lectures were pretty dry and uninteresting. The discussion part of the class, which was the only BME portion, barely related topics to the biomedical field. I thought professor Kim was unorganized and pretty lazy, so most of the material learned is only what is covered in the civil engineering 216 lecture. It was overall an okay course, the midterms and final were pretty difficult but the homework wasn't that bad.",
          "This class is a lot of work, but progresses at a steady pace and does not jump from topic to topic.",
          "N\u02fa",
          "The course was alright. The labs are no trouble but the homework can be tedious.",
          "CivE216 was a good, if not great, course. The lectures were methodical, even plodding, but the book and online resources helped me absorb the material with ease. However, I think some more effort should be put into improving the labs--particularly the deflection lab, which was difficult because it took place well before beam deflections were covered in class.",
          "Civil Engineering mostly consists of memorization of formulas. There's not a lot of in depth analysis outside of applying equations. Rudnicki is not a very good lecturer, and I found myself teaching myself for the most part. I learned the majority of the second half of the class from the textbook, as the lectures didn't get the info to me very clearly. Rudnicki has the tendency to spend a lot of time on the theory behind equations. This is great, but he tends to confuse us and himself when delving too deep into material.",
          "It's a dry class and the professor seems confused most of the time. If you ask a question that is not in his notes, he can't answer it. Most of the class time is spent stumbling through algebra on the board and being very upset about mistakes. I think that the material is very important for ME majors but you kind of have to learn it on your own.",
          "Overall this class was good! Rudnicky does a solid job at teaching the material and tests were fair. The grading on the exams was not always done well, so it was important to check midterms after grading because points could be taken off seemingly arbitrarily. However, the professor was great about regrades, and more points could be given back. The professor overall really cared about his students, he was always checking in to see how people were feeling about concepts and how he could improve the class. The labs weren't too bad and there were only 4 towards the beginning of the quarter which was nice",
          "It's fine. Everyone who is taking it is taking it because it's a requirement so you all just get through it together. Would recommend at least going to class and listening. Overall not much actual material in the class, so a lot of days are just going through examples. You should get a good lab group though because the labs require a lot of writing even if they only take up at most an hour of the two hour time slot. Class is two midterms, four labs, weekly homework assignments, and a final",
          "This class is not bad for a required course. Rudnicki is boring after a few weeks, but a generally nice guy and very helpful for outside questions. The lectures are stale so make sure you have a friend or two in class!",
          "This course was over an interesting topic but was not taught correctly and that made it hard to enjoy.",
          "This course was more work than it probably should've been",
          "This is an ok class. Prof. Rudnicki is an alright lecturer, and you can tell he's interested in the topics. That said, he does not always explain things well enough. When working examples, he often does not explain why he's doing each step, why he's taking a particular approach. The homework load is reasonable, and I would highly suggest doing the readings to supplement his lectures.",
          "This class was engaging and covered a lot of concepts efficiently. The daily online homework forced you to keep up which was SUPER helpful for learning the material, and the program helped you figure out your mistakes. The tests were very fair and the homework assignments were very well paced.",
          "This is quite possibly the worst class I've ever taken. We would walk in to the classroom, and the professor would start writing on the board immediately in illegible writing just solving random problems without explaining what to do. The only reason I'm even passing this course is because I do my work, and I watch videos of other teachers teaching the material online before the exam."

          "This is one of my favorite courses I have taken at Northwestern. I thought the lectures were both interesting and helpful and I was particularly interested in the material because I think it is extremely applicable to real-life engineering.",
          "Very reasonable class. Many applicable concepts and Alarcon is an amazing teacher who is very passionate and cares about her students. The more examples problems you do the more you will get out of the class. If you put in the effort she will do her best to help you succeed.",
          "Arancha is a fantastic professor. Only take this class with her. I struggled in EA2, so I thought I was going to struggle in this class - that was not the case! She helped clarify everything and truly cares about her students success. She gives you all the tools to do well, you just have to use them.",
          "The instruction for the course was extremely helpful, every class lecture, video posted, and FAQs all helped lead to a better understanding of what was happening. At times the homework were extremely time confusing but always assigned far in advance.",
          "If you have the chance to take CivE216 with Professor Alarcon, please do. She is absolutely one of the kindest and most capable professors I've ever had. She takes the time to get to know each student's name, goes out of her way to explain concepts in multiple ways so that students who learn differently can succeed equally well, and is just a really talented, effective teacher. Her passion for the topic makes it much more interesting to learn as well. The midterms were challenging but overall, fair. Make sure to do extra problems and to take advantage of office hours. Overall, this class was a great experience, especially due to Professor Alarcon.",
          "Prpfessor Alarcon was absolutely fantastic and provided so any different ways to learn the material, whether posting her own written, thurough hw solutions online, her remarkable videos, or just houng over the problems in class through multiple different ways.",
          "Arancha is the best!!!! Take it with Alarcon she actually cares about her students and makes an effort to get to know them! Go to her office hours she's amazing!!!",
          "This class is very interesting and necessary towards BME. The homeworks were great practice and lectures were very thorough.",
          "The professor was very approachable, clear, organized, and extremely helpful. I found the material interesting and very applicable to my major. The class style was great as we did lots of practice problems in class but also went over concepts even when online lectures were posted regarding those topics. The pace of the course was very manageable but I still felt that I learned a lot.",
          "I loved Dr. Alarcon's way of teaching and learned alot in this class. While the material may seem unimportant with how computers are used to run all of the calculations, Knowing how the equations work is super useful. I suggest anyone who is an MechE to take this class especially with Dr. Alarcon. If I could I would take this class again.",
          "It is a required course for my major, which means it helps me to advance my skill. So in that sense it is necessary to master relevant problem solving skills",
          "This course was critical to developing an approach to structural loading and failure analysis that I was using directly in Mech 240 during the same quarter. We moved quickly enough that I didn't struggle at all to apply what I was learning directly to my other subject and I actually believe it helped me reinforce the material by taking both simultaneously.",
          "Very good teacher, material is tough but definitely doable. Online resources provided by professor are great. Take it with her.",
          "I really thought Ms. Alarcon was a motivating, friendly and helpful teacher. She gladly anwered any questions in class and encouraged everybody to speak their mind to further understand what was being taught in class. Most importantly, her enthusiasm for her field of work could not go unnoticed. The class was pretty forward. If you get a hang of the logic this course will be easy yet insightful.",
          "Alarcon is a pretty good teacher and cares a lot. She gives you all the tools to do well so just check Canvas and go to her office hours. I\u027d say go to class for her thorough explanations especially for new topics. We learn a lot of material in this course but overall it's not too demanding.",
          "Very good class that is taught very well. Even if you only have a passing interest in the field, it is a very good class to take for basic engineering requirements. One thing to note is that the exams tend to be very rushed.",
          "This class is as advertised. The first half of the quarter is easy, and then the difficulty picks up pretty quickly into the end of the quarter. The midterms are pretty long, so you have to work fast if you want to finish.",
          "Prof. Alarcon is really passionate and inspiring. I am not a CivE (IEMS) and I adimt that I felt constantly excited about learning the material even thought it has nothing to do with my major. Prof. Alarcon, is very attentive and tries a variety of different approaches to have students learn the material. She would have students come to the board and try practice problems, was readily available for OH, and NEVER disregarded a question --she was always excited to clear any doubts.",
          "Prof. Alarcon is a great lecturer - she explains concepts very well, comes up with a vast amount of resources to help students with understand both the knowledge of the subject and knowledge of completing exams/homework, and cares for her students.",
          "This class would be awful without Alarcon. I hated EA2 and thought it was a real pain. But Alarcon made this class super easy and even relatively interesting. Definitely would take again. I don't recommend the BME section though.",
          "This is a wonderful class. I know it is a requirement for many, but let yourself enjoy it. The homework and the exams are incredibly fair. If you go to class and listen and work through the problems with Professor Alarcon, you will do well. The class is organized and she equips you with everything you need to succeed and learn a lot. One of the first classes where you feel that what you're learning is applicable to the real world. Love this class.",
          "Great class and not too difficult. Great teaching style and tools",
          "Alarcon is a good lecturer. Not a hard class if you go to lecture. I was able to complete the homework very quickly each week but it was a little annoying to have to use the yellow engineering paper. Labs are easy, but the write up can take a few hours as a group.",
          "Professor Alarcon is organized and gives many resources including videos, solutions, and supplemental information. She has a good teaching style, is always excited about the class, and genuinely wants every student to do well.",
          "Interesting to learn a little more about architecture and civil engineering in general, though I can't imagine myself doing it as a career",
          "Take it with Alacron. Enough said.",
          "I can't imagine taking this class with anyone other than Alarcon. She makes it so easy to do well, and if you follow her advice and do the problems when you should, you'll do well in this class.",
          "Alarcon is an especially dedicated and helpful professor. She really wants you to learn. It's a lot of work, but if you put in the time you can keep up. Do practice problems and you'll probably be fine.",
          "V good idea to take this course with Alarcon. She explains topics very clearly and tells you exactly what you need to know. Exams are pretty straightforward and are similar to the practice exams.",
          "The curriculum is very straight forward and easy to follow.",
          "This course covers material that is integral to basic engineering, especially skills that will be the foundation for other classes.",
          "Alacron is very systematic which can be a drag sometimes, but follow her process and you will do well.",
          "Class was exactly as a expected to be.",
          "Not a big fan of the material but the professor was very helpful and put so many resources out there for you to learn",
          "This course was good. The labs were not that difficult and the homework was a good representation of the exams.",
          "Teacher was really helpful.",
          "Great course. Very interesting. Not a lot of required busy work like in a lot of classes, so you really get what you put into the course.",
          "I think this class is a perfect follow-up to EA2. Having taken the two sequentially made for a very natural transition. Of course, the topics are more advanced than those of EA2, but it never felt overwhelming. Overall, I enjoyed learning about mechanics of materials much more than I would have expected.",
          "This course emphasized large number crunching methods that was good practice for engineering but proved to be difficult to understand and impossible to apply in my other classes.",
          "Take this class with Alarcon -- she's the best. Do the practice and homework at least mostly by yourself and it shouldn't be too hard of a class.",
          "I actually had fun with the material in this course and enjoyed solving the problems. I remember struggling with the subject in the engineering analysis course and finding it rather boring but Professor Alarcon was so passionate about the topic that it was hard not to be interested in it with her. She made the lectures very clear and organized, which I really appreciated. She clearly cares about her students and go way beyond her way to help each and every student that she can in any way.",
          "Professor Alarcon is an amazing professor who truly cares about her students and is passionate about what she teaches. She's incredibly talented at teaching and makes this course a breeze.",
          "The lecture was extremely helpful because we went through examples in class. The professor took time to explain and also had examples to help enforce the concepts we learned.",
          "Good class. Great teacher. Very helpful, especially if you ask for it. Exams kind of long, not unfair though. Overall ok.",
          "I love how much passion Prof Alarcon puts into this class and her students. I can tell that she really cares sincerely about both the material and our learning. I think she is a great professor and I appreciate her teaching style, organization, and jokes.",
          "This is a course with somewhat challenging criteria but a great professor. If you go to class and be present and attentive, you should do well in the course. Make sure that you do as many practice problems as you can, as they are a very good representation of what will be on the exams.",
          "It was fine, not incredibly interesting but probably helpful when we begin designing structures.",
          "Alarcon is an amazing teacher who actually cares about how her students are learning. If you're going to take this course, try to take it with her! Also, this class is all about the amount of work you put in. It's not hard to do well if you just spend time practicing all the problem.",
          "I really enjoyed Professor Alarcon's method of teaching. You could really tell that she cared about her students. I never went into office hours, but I'm sure she would be very helpful. If you don't understand a method she's teaching, I think it's easy to ask her for another way to think about it. I didn't really like the separate class for BME students. I wish it was integrated into our daily lectures. I don't think non-BME students would be upset if Profesor Alarcon used a bone structure to show an example. I think it would make the lectures more interesting.",
          "This course was easy for those looking for a distribution requirement. The homework and labs are straightforward, and the midterms aren't bad either.",
          "Flexible grading schema makes it so no one has to drop the class after a midterm or a bad assignment. Grading schema can include using your final as 70% of your grade. BEWARE THOUGH- the final is hard!!",

          "Alarcon is very passionate, which makes her a good professor... But i thought the midterms were absurdly long and not always the most consistent with the material we learned",
          "The course was helpful in applying equilibrium physics to deformations.",
          "Being an IE major first thought I would really dislike this class. It turns out I sort of liked it. It was really nice to take a freshman/sophomore when knowing others in the class. If one is IE major it sort of what you make of it: if you try to like it and work hard then the class isn't bad. Alarcon was the best and really helpful. I wouldn't want to take it with anyone else. Go to lecture! It is 100% a toss up to do the lab or the BME section. The BME lecture and the labs are the worst part of the class.",
          "UNDERSTAND BASICS ABOUT MATERIALS REACTION TO LOADING",
          "This was one of my best experiences in a McCormick classroom. The professor made a real effort to understand the needs of the students and tailor lectures to those needs. She laid out the course in an extremely organized fashion and stuck to the schedule. The problem sets were reasonable and assisted the learning process.",
          "It's a good class, and Prof. Alarcon really does care about students. It's not a bad choice to take after EA2, since a lot of the concepts build on statics."

          "This class stimulated interest in the area because of how it incorporated real world problems. It made you want to learn what was happening to better prepare yourself for future problems.",
          "This is a tough course, but well structured. If you listen to her advice, do the problems in the book, actually do the homework, you will succeed. Similar to math courses, if you put in the work you will succeed, but will miserably fail if you half ass it.",
          "I really enjoyed this course! I think the material that was covered is very applicable to real life, and Alarcon does well in relating what we are learning to real life examples. I think that her tests are very fair, and you know exactly what she will cover. So as long as you do practice problems before exams and review your notes, you are bound to do well. She is very picky about her homework, so make sure to follow the guidelines exactly before submitting them. Overall I really enjoyed the course and would recommend it for anybody needing a basic engineering course.",
          "Professor Alarcon is the best! She really cares about her students and gives you every opportunity to succeed in the class, including lots of extra credit. Go to class and office hours and you should be just fine. The BME discussion is far worse; I don't feel like I learned anything from that part of the class, but the amount of work isn't excessive so that should be fine too.",
          "Prof.Alarcon is a great teacher. Kind, helpful and it is obvious that she thought about the course and cares deeply about it. I would recommend taking this course.",
          "I mostly enjoyed the material, and found that the problems still required a lot of thinking and problem solving even though the class centers around only a few formulas.",
          "Pretty good class. Homework\u2019s can be long and labs seem kind of pointless, but the problems are somewhat interesting and Prof Alarcon is really great.",
          "Had to take this as a distro for basic engineering. I should have taken it earlier (a quarter or two after taking EA2). Had to play a little catch-up, but not a bad course. Grading system wants you to do well, as does the Professor. Problem sets are time consuming, not that helpful for learning the material in my opinion.",
          "Alarcon was an incredible lecturer and really cares for her students. She has a lot of resources to help students learn and reading the textbook is helpful as well. The midterms + final are organized well and are not too bad. There is also a lenient grading system so that you can have your final count for most of your grade if you mess up on a midterm. The BME discussion section for this class was organized pretty poorly however. I feel like the BME section is pretty useless in addition and seems like it only brings down your grade if anything. Some topics in the discussion are interesting, but do not match up well with what we are learning in lecture and are not in depth enough to actually learn anything substantive.",
          "do the hw and youll be fine",
          "The course is taught very well and if you listen in class, you will do well. As far as actual content, however, it is very civil-focused, and so seems not very applicable from a BME standpoint.",
          "Really enjoyed this class, Professor Alarcon is amazing and very very helpful. Make sure to go to lecture and sitting up front helps with focusing since it\u2019s quite a large class.",
          "Arancha is a great teacher, she really cares that her students do well and if you go to class you will learn and she will tell you exactly what is on exams which are very fair. The material itself is difficult so expect to put in some time studying and doing the homework. However, the labs are a useless but easy one hour.",
          "I was able to learn more about the material and challenge myself on the material",
          "I thought this course was really well taught. It was definitely challenging but nothing that was too difficult.",
          "This class builds on EA-2, and I would recommend it highly for Basic Engineering. Alarcon posts a lot of opportunities for practice problems, videos and practice exams. She wants her students to do well and really cares. She is far and away the best professor in McCormick. Show up to class and take notes, do the practice exams, sit in the front of class and this class will be very manageable. I wish I could take a class with her every quarter!",
          "The course was very organized which was nice. I always knew what we were doing, why, and how it related to the other material in the course. As a Civil Engineering major it also felt directly related to my future work. Professor Alarcon is great - she's a good teacher and genuinely cares about whether you learn the material. The material is definitely challenging and you need to spend a long time doing homeworks and studying, but if you put in the time it's not too hard to actually learn the material.",
          "I taught myself most the material for this class. I attended every lecture but didn't really get a ton out of them as things were not explained well. The only lectures that were worth while were the ones that were the day before the test. She did a really good job of reviewing all the material. Tests were fair and not too difficult, similar to homeworks but easier. Homeworks were decently long but helped with tests. All in all it was an average class.",
          "Prof. Alarcon-Flemming is a wonderful professor who gives her all to make sure you understand what's going on. Only drawback I personally saw was that she tends to diatance herself from being accesible by providing a sht ton of supplementary examples and documents. If you're like me and have a busy schedule and dont necessarily have. The time to come through several quarters worth of information for clarifications, I strongly recommend prioritizing her and the TA office hours!",
          "This course was similar to EA2. I enjoyed the way that it was taught and that there were so many resources that could be accessed if you are ever confused. If you can take this course with professor Alarcon you should she is amazing.",
          "The civil engineering part of the class was quite fair and the professor provided a lot of material to study from. Perhaps the lecture notes could be a bit clearer to follow, but otherwise it was fair. The BME part of the class was a bit lacking, but I still learned some interesting things from it.",
          "This course was fairly easy especially because Alarcon is a good teacher. Doing all of the homeworks and practice midterms was normally enough to do very well. concepts are not too difficult overall, it's more about being able to do things quickly on the tests. The labs are absolutely pointless, you spend about an hour just breaking or bending or twisting samples and then write the lab report. An easy boost for your grade but I felt like I got nothing out of them personally.",
          "This course is good because you can keep up with the work, it's well organized, and the professor really wants you to learn.",
          "Alarcon is a great professor. She explains things very clearly and it's fairly easy to do well in the class. The weekly homeworks are pretty time consuming but doable. The exams are very fair. It is so worth it to look at the solutions for all old exams posted on Canvas. I really enjoyed the fun fact Fridays.",
          "feel like it could use restructuring, more relevant problems, less focus on doing things only one way and more openness to different approaches.",
          "Excellent course, but challenging. You have to work at it.",
          "It was a good course to supplement other courses that I'm taking. Some of the material can be a little dry but with the right professor you learn a lot .",
          "The instructor really tried to make it interesting for everybody.",
          "It's not too bad, labs are dumb but easy. Do your HW, you'll be fine.",
          "I loved this class! Absolutely take it with Professor Alarcon because she is so passionate about civ e and knows so much! She is super accommodating and willing to help. Also, she takes the time to get to know her students which is refreshing when most engineering professors are just there to teach the material. This course is challenging but if you put in the time and do all the practice problems, an A is obtainable.",
          "This course was great! I'm maybe biased as this is the material that I want to work with for the rest of my life, but Professor Alarcon is genuinely incredible. She teaches the material so thoroughly and energetically. Going to class is definitely key and will make prepping for exams infinitely better. Honestly, she teaches so well that I found myself leaving class with an excellent grasp on the material and simply needed to do practice problems before each exam to increase my speed and full understanding. I would definitely recommend this class and definitely take it with Professor Alarcon.",
          "Prof. Alarcon was a very good lecturer, and made herself endlessly available for any sort of extra help. We did a lot of review (almost every day), which did get a little old but it probably helped a lot. Homeworks are excellent tools to learn the concepts, and without them I wouldn't have done near as well in the course.",
          "This class was really enjoyable. It taught material in a way that introduces why structures around you are built the way they are.",
          "The course was thorough and it contained a lot of information relating to civil engineering.",
          "If you're taking this course it is probably because you have to. It's applications can actually be interesting and Prof. Alarcon is fantastic. The labs are pretty dumb and not that helpful, but manageable.",
          "I think that this course was extremely well taught by Professor Alarcon. The material covered is extremely applicable to engineering in general, and she makes sure to give plenty of real life applications as well as plenty of sample problems so that students are able to master keu concepts.",
          "Learned most of the material on my own doing the homework.",
          "I found this class relatively interesting going in and I liked the course as a whole. I found it very important to follow along in class and go to office hours and look at the extra examples given on canvas. Tests were fair, homework took some time every week, and doing practice problems was the most helpful in the class.",
          "This course was intellectually challenging, but also interesting. I think it is beneficial to have a background in general physics, like EA2, but that it's not imperative.",
          "I really enjoyed the fact that the professor took time to make videos breaking down the important concepts of the course.",
          "It was really helpful.",
          "As the course progressed, and study habits declined in quality. This course did an exceptional job of making relevant study material EASILY and QUICKLY available as well as thorough and pleasant to follow.",
          "Honestly, I was really dreading this class, but Professor Alarcon made this class pretty enjoyable. If you put in the time to studying and understanding the concepts it's not that bad. There were a few concepts that went way over my head the first few days, but once I sat down to learn them they weren't bad. The class is structured for you to succeed (there are different ways for your grade to be calculated, a bunch of grades that impact your overall grade, and tons of bonus points), so if you try you can do well.",
          "Being a senior in industrial engineering (and given that this was my senior spring quarter), I literally had zero interest in the materials taught in this course. My previous experiences with other basic engineering courses were 'okay' at best as I found them to be boring. But this one was different. The level of energy and passion that Professor Alarcon brings to this course is pretty amazing. She also makes the experience of going to class more enjoyable by occasionally providing us with the real-world examples of civil engineering applications. You can just tell from the way she treats her students that she genuinely wants you to succeed in this class; she is always willing to help so don't be afraid to reach out to her. The labs are not very difficult as they actually relate back to the materials learned during the lectures. There are also plenty of resources on Canvas available for you to do well on the exams. I seriously would have considered a different major (e.g. Civ E or BME, etc) if I had taken this class earlier in my Northwestern career.",
          "I was hoping to apply my knowledge from ea2 to this course and learn about civ e in the real world but did not end up learning much. Class was hard to follow and so boring (not because of Alarcon, but because it has nothing to do with my future work/what I'm studying) so I therefore did not enjoy the class. Not nearly as easy as I thought it would be",
          "Super helpful for Mech E. Doing as many practice problems as possible really helps.",
          "I very much enjoyed this class. I felt that the combination of labs, classes, and quizzes that tested our knowledge of the core principles of the class gave me a deeper understanding of Civil Engineering.",
          "If you are going to take this course, definitely take it with Alarcon. She is incredibly nice and extremely fair. She posts all of her solutions to everything, so you can see how she does problems. Many exam questions are taken straight from previous exams, so it's possible to do very well on tests. The hws are not too bad",
          "Alarcon is amazing!!! She really cares about each and every one of her students doing well in her class and gives the class more than enough materials to succeed. She doesn't hesitate to go back and explain a confusing concept again but also holds her class to high standards and expects you to put in work outside of class. She knows the material extremely well and explains it clearly and concisely.",
          "The 4 days a week part that is taught by Alarcon is fantastic, she is great and you will do fine if you just go to class. The once a week BME 271 part taught by Gloria Kim needs to be updated. We had quizzes over things that were sometimes taught later in the class that we did not know, or were just quizzes over things we would never need to know\u02fdid not apply. Kim also doesnt really lecture so much as just read slides to you so fast you dont really pick up anything. Very strange and I hope that this part of the class is changed.",
          "It was hard the first time and it is still hard the second time but I think I'm going to pass this time. So that's nice",
          "a bit daunting and overwhelmed with content",
          "Prof. Alarcon is great. The homework can be tough, but it's a great way to learn. The BME recitation started out kinda boring, but once Prof. Kim took our suggestions into consideration, they got better.",
          "I loved this class. I am terrible about teaching myself from a textbook but did not need to use it one bit as prof Alarcon's lectures are crystal clear and her exams are fair. I considered taking more CIVE classes because of this class.",
          "Great class with a really fast pace and lots of problem-solving.",
          "Great course, this is how engineering courses should be structured. Chapters are formatted very nicely so that each is related and built on previously learned concepts. Professor Alarcon is great, you can really see her passion through her teaching. She provides so many resources and practice problems on Canvas that makes it straightforward and easy to review for tests.",
          "Classes and the playlists are extremely useful- take the time to be there and pay attention, and it will pay off well on the homeworks and quizzes.",
          "I love how Prof Alacron is so patient and so willing to help us learn!! She is an excellent teacher!",
          "Really not too bad. Important that you stay on top of everything. Easy to follow but since it meets everyday, we covered a lot of topics and playing catchup was no fun. Homework wasn't too bad. Make sure you follow her exact formatting or she will give you a zero."

          "The material isn't difficult, but digital signal processing is much more of a maths topic than an engineering one or even a modeling one, so at times it felt like what I was expecting of the course and what the course was aiming to be were at odds with the material we were actually supposed to be covering. The lectures really need to be more in the format of a maths lecture, and if possible, reformated with a strong sense for what needs to be emphasized for students to understand the mathematical mechanism behind their calculations, or else what is not an inherently difficult topic becomes almost completely impossible to understand to the fullest. I felt lost for a good portion of this quarter, and I read the textbook multiple times, did the problems we were assigned and then some, and continually didn't feel like my grasp of the material was strong enough to constitute mastery or preparedness for an exam. Professor MacIver put a lot of effort into making the course amenable to students, but I think just in how discursive the lectures were and how long they took to convey information and how math-heavy the class is for what was taught from a mostly application-based perspective, a lot of his efforts fell short.",
          "MacIver's lecture style made it impossible to learn the material in this class. I think if he vastly improved his lecture style, this course would be about fifty times easier and fifty times less frustrating. Also, the labs are way too long and repetitive.",
          "MacIver was new to teaching and SO super cool and nice, but he really had trouble with calibrating the pace and the rigor of the class. The first exam was okay, the makeup exam was crazy difficult, and the final was super reasonable. I had a lot of trouble knowing what was going to be tested, and the syllabus was completely wrong.",
          "This class could have been good if it were taught in a different manner. The labs were tedious and covered topics that we hadn't covered in class yet, so it was difficult to get much out of them. No solutions were ever given to homework problems so it was impossible to do practice problems in preparation for tests. It theoretically should have been a really easy class, but there number of resources to learn from was lacking, with the only helpful ones being the textbook and peer mentor.",
          "This class was not taught very well at all, the textbook and resources given were not sufficient to help us learn the topics. It was mostly self-taught, and you have to go to office hours if you want to do well. Overall, the material was not super difficult, but learning it was not easy.",
          "The actual material is not that hard; however, trying to figure out what you need to know is a struggle.",
          "This course needs to be remodeled. Most of the important concepts were taught very quickly or not at all. We were completely unprepared for the homeworks and labs. The professor and TA were not too helpful. Exams were fair as long as you can teach yourself the material.",
          "He\u2019s a nice person and he seemed to care how we did and that we learned, but he didn\u2019t really know how to make that happen. The class was so unorganized and unclear. Homeworks were always due different days and some weeks not others, labs were inconsistent I never knew if the upcoming weekend I was going to have to devote 10+ hours on a saturday to finishing a lab or not (yes, that happened, it's crazy). Quizzes on Monday would include stuff we literally learned the morning of and barely had time to actually learn and cram before the quiz. Studying didn\u2019t align with a good score because it was really arbitrary what we would be quizzed on.",
          "Lectures\u2026he spent a lot of time writing sentences and words, a lot of which was word for word reiterated from the textbook. And if he did examples they were often the same ones from the book. So the book did not supplement lecture and lecture did not supplement the book unfortunately. It would have been so helpful to actually do different examples in class so I could actually learn the concepts later on on my own. And speaking of examples, I wish he didn\u2019t just keep them general but instead used examples of a problem we may be given on homework or a test, instead of just the general formula definition with variables. What we learned in class did not prepare us for what kinds of problems we were faced with figuring out on the homeworks, let alone tests and quizzes. I used google and you tube videos to learn so much of what I ended up knowing how to do. We were given labs on things we didn\u2019t learn until 2-3 weeks later so they took a ridiculously unneccesary amount of time and kind of made no sense or i didn't have the background to understand what I was doing with matlab. Towards the end of the class we were all of a sudden expected to do a bunch of proofs for some reason which is not at all what the class was up until then. He spent a lot of time trying to convince us that signals were important, which is fine and great and I get that, but teach me how to actually do the math. And I don\u2019t learn by \u201cplaying with signals\u201d on matlab, I learn by doing concrete examples with numbers on paper, especially since that is what we are expected to do on a test. The content itself is not hard, but it was presented not in a clear step by step way so it seemed really confusing, and steps were often skipped and math steps not written out or explained, and I didn\u2019t have enough examples to compare to see how to apply a concept to different problems. We never are able to see solutions to any of the problems we do in homework that we get wrong (it\u2019s just marked wrong) or any of the other practice problems in the book. So we can\u2019t learn from our mistakes, and also I really understand problems by seeing examples of how they are supposed to be done and then I make sense of it. And we\u2019ve had basically none of that. The class was just made a lot harder, more complicated, and with more stress and anxiety and time than I think it needed to be or should have been. And what I put into it didn't translate to what I got out of it so I felt pretty defeated by the end. Hoping this will change for next year though so maybe it'll be better.",
          "This course has easily been my least favorite class that I have taken here at NU. The lectures were extremely unorganized, half of the in class examples had mistakes in them, the tests and homeworks were unnecessarily difficult, and solutions to these were not distributed, so they was no way of knowing why you did something wrong/how to fix it. Office hours were basically required to be successful in this class, so if they didn't fit in with your schedule, you were pretty much screwed.",
          "This class material was okay and not too hard but the way it was presented made it much more difficult than it needed to be. It almost moved too slow also.",
          "It felt like the professor was just reiterating the book. I'm not convinced he understood the content fully. Much of the class did not attend his lectures because of this. In addition, we didn't even go through one of the big 3 concepts that were supposed to be covered in this class.",
          "This class was a mess. The stuff we learned in the first two weeks seems completely irrelevant to the actual course objectives, we would have to complete (Matlab) labs on topics we had yet to learn in class, we weren't given the solutions to any homework problems so we didn't know what we did wrong, some of the \"quizzes\" were way too long, the prof didn't seem to have a great grasp of the material (at least not well enough to communicate these concepts to students who have never heard of these things before), etc. Honestly the material doesn't even seem to be that hard but the way in which it is presented makes it really hard to learn it. Hopefully this class will be structured better next year.",
          "This was rough. The professor made this course 100 times harder than it needed to be. The lectures were characterized by the professor writing on his Microsoft Surface almost illegibly with too many words and nowhere near enough examples. He was unable to go through an example problem and explain why he was taking the steps he took. A very poor experience.",
          "This is a math-heavy course, and it's not harder than ones you've already taken. The professor is OK at explaining things, but not especially good. That plus the fact that homework is taken from the textbook means you do need to rent or buy it. The TA for the class was Urgurcan, who is not good at explaining things and is a very demanding grader.",
          "THIS CLASS WAS AWFUL. I'm truly sorry that you have to take it, and I really hope it gets better for you. The course lacked any organization - couldn't use the syllabus because it wasn't what our professor followed, professor constantly stated that we were falling behind (despite not even learning the material effectively when covering it the first time), and there were no example questions we could work on practicing with because no solutions were posted online. The labs were awful and disconnected from the course because we had not covered the material prior to completing the labs - and overall this class sucked. Good luck.",
          "The teacher did not really know what he was doing. He was a very nice guy who was very excited and motivated and I think that he has the potential to be a good teacher in the future. However, he essentially wrote out full sentences from the text book on the lectures which were just generally not even readable in the first place. He also failed to demonstrate with examples or give us any resources for the course including solutions to any of the problem sets, quizzes, or tests for reference.",
          "Course structure lacking, resulting in confusion and ineffective use of time.",
          "The material itself wasn't that bad, reading the book and going to TA and student peer office hours was really helpful.",
          "This course helped me learn a bit about signals, but not all of the material from the syllabus was covered in lecture. The lectures were difficult to understand.",
          "Wow. What to say about BME 306. Malcolm seems to be a pretty nice guy that keeps rambling on about specifics of a subject of which almost literally no one understands the basics. He clearly has never spoken to Hao Zhang (the instructor of BME 305) about what we did or learned in that class and therefore expects us to have random knowledge that we don't have and continues speaking about things we've already done. Add to all of this the fact that the class is in complete disarray, with not even the syllabus getting an update from year to year."

          "This was a confusing course because you never really knew what you were doing and how it related to things in real life. It was kind of unorganized- not the professor but the actual material of the class.",
          "From what I hear, this course has been terrible in the past. Professor Gentry tried genuinely to make it better, and succeeded in a lot of ways. The exams were fair, but challenging, the problem sets were as short as they could be while still covering all the material we were supposed to learn, and overall the class was taught well. A couple gripes with prof Gentry were that the exams were handwritten so sometimes reading them was tough, and his scanner didn't show pencil well so if he\u027d post handwritten notes online they\u027d be illegible. Other than that, Gentry is a great professor who made this class accessible and (sometimes) fun. Labs were also not awful - having a real-life goal in labs makes them a lot more palatable, especially compared to EA4 labs.",
          "Good course, you'll learn a lot especially with regard to Fourier transforms and signal analysis. Professor Gentry is great and extremely fair and understanding. Course greatly exceeded my expectations.",
          "I learned a lot in BME 306. The textbook was very very difficult to follow because it was not clear and sometimes assumed the reader knew more than you would expect him or her to. The lectures were helpful only if the textbook was read in advance because most of the teaching is directed using examples instead of theory explanations.",
          "Good class, but Prof. gentry isn't great at explaining content and brushes by a lot of topics.",
          "I didn't find the material to be that hard, but the textbook is terrible and essentially can't be relied on to supplement the lectures very well. I had heard not so great things about Gentry coming into this class, but I actually thought he was a pretty good teacher.",
          "Labs are super annoying but the hw is usually not terrible. Prof Gentry is mostly okay. Sometimes a little scatter-brained but overall not much worse than 305",
          "I didn't know what to expect coming into this course and I honestly just feel average coming out of it. The material wasnt interesting, the textbook also was poor guidance in terms of the information and our professor did pretty much the best he good given the circumstances.",
          "Often confusing what we were learning about.",
          "Gentry is a great guy. If you keep up with the work and actively participate in the labs you should find this class isn't too hard.",
          "It was a difficult course that was rather intense on the time commitment, usually needlessly so. Homework often could have been done more quickly if concepts were taught with greater detail (sometimes the concepts were introduced the day the assignment was due, which was irritating) \u2014 if they keep the Tervo book, nearly half of it is wrong as Prof. Gentry points out, so the fact that there's so much pushback from the BME dept. to fix what is a perennially train wreck of a sequence is pretty disheartening. Labs are irrelevant outright, and the grading criteria is so unclear they might as well not have one (the TA grading the labs had approved of our outputs in the lab period when asked and then docked us mercilessly for the same items, most likely because she did not really understand the task/grading criteria herself). Overall, it was a frustrating experience, but Prof. Gentry is a nice guy \u2014 it's a shame that it was under this context that I met him since he's leaving me with such a bitter taste in my mouth.",
          "The labs are annoying because you get a new random group every week, but they build on each other so the new groups have to spend time consolidating code because everyone uses different variable names. It's a pretty manageable class. The TA was great and really helpful and willing to work with you. Gentry is good, but if you don't immediately understand he's not great at being able to explain it but he'll try really hard.",
          "This course was mostly a math class. Professor Gentry openly told us \"you probably aren't going to use this information after the final.\" Exams were fair.",
          "It's hard to be motivated in a class when the professor starts the first lecture with \"You're probably never going to use this in real life\".",
          "This course was better than what I\u027d expected after reading the CTECs from previous years. We had useful examples in class and homework, and the exams were quite straightforward based on practice provided by Prof. Gentry. The class is structured where you do have to get a 94% to earn an A, with only individual assignments (read: midterm) being curved. Therefore, you have to constantly deliver if you want to score high.",
          "Can be a bit hard and labs were confusing as we didn\u2019t know how we\u2019d be graded, but Gentry was open to help and the assignments and exams are to the point",
          "this isn't that hard of a class, but Gentry is not a great teacher and the textbook sucks.",
          "Gentry tried. This course is not actually that bad, but the teaching methods were bad. It was his first year, so I don't really blame him. Make sure to over-prepare for exams because the midterm definitely hit us harder than we expected. Lectures are boring, but sometimes the textbook is wrong so I guess it's necessary to go. Labs are annoying but definitely not as bad as 305 labs because they're all MATLAB; lab groups are randomized each week though so good luck.",
          "Math heavy course, the application to bme was a little loose, but tests were fair so success wasn't unattainable.",
          "Too much math but Gentry was really cool.",
          "Gentry teaching this is definitely a positive. He stripped down the material to what you need to know pretty well, exams are fairly straight forward too. Lectures could be a bit dry, but I think he does an adequate job of presenting material that a lot of people may not find fascinating. The book is horrible however, lots of errors, homework is extremely ambiguous. Office hours are fairly imperative to understanding what you're supposed to do to complete the assignments. Overall not the worst class I've taken in BME",
          "Very good and interesting class, but a lot of examples in bith lecture and the text books are just wrong (mess up algebra, drop a constant, etc.). As long as you keep track of these issues and bring them up in class to have them corrected, course makes sense, bur can also cause a lot of confusion if not corrected.",
          "Lecture is confusing, it feels both necessary and like a waste of time all at once. Lab was actually interesting and manageable, and really seemed like the only useful part of the course. Gentry moved quickly through material and often did not explain why we would do something unless someone specifically asked \"why\". Homework was difficult to complete and the textbook is pretty much useless and riddled with errors. Often times, the TA would have incorrect solutions which made it hard for them to provide usefull help.",
          "I think Gentry is really good at explaining the conceptual parts of this class, but when it comes to the math and more exact methods not so much. I think he might be too chill for that. I feel like somethings were assumed to be easy to understand, but they weren't. Also, the labs in the class were frustrating. Not because of the content but mostly because of the structure of them. They built off each other and we changed groups every week. I don't think it works to have both. One or the other.",
          "BME 306 is quite the class. The book used for this class is absolutely no help. There are not enough examples, and there are not even odd answers in the back so you can do other practice problems. The information is not always clear when being taught. Doing the homework takes far too long for only a couple of problems as a result. This might have been solved with a better book. Additionally, the labs start out fine and progressively end up getting more and more unclear as to what exactly is wanted. Also, switching lab groups every week was not helpful, because the stuff needed for lab carried over every week so it was hard having three people with different versions to work from.",
          "Kinda confusing topics but professor gentry and the undergraduate ta are both super helpful if you go to office hours.",
          "Very boring with no context. Took a lot of time especially with a terrible book to self teach the content",
          "Professor Gentry did a good job. The class was fairly manageable, just the problem sets occasionally seemed overly difficult because they did not exactly line up with the lecture material. Also, the textbook itself was fairly confusing and not helpful in trying to learn the material. The tests were fair.",
          "It was alright",
          "The course was particularly challenging for me. The material was very abstract at times and wasn't taught very clearly.",
          "It is a good course. The professor is very caring."

I learned a lot and have a new found interest in circuits and mechanical engineering. The exams are not super difficult if you study. Overall, one of my favorite classes I've taken at NU.",
          "Great course, homework assignments and labs really help to solidify material taught in class.",
          "The powerpoints were really crowded and we never actually spent time on them fully in class. His writing was messy/hard to follow and i feel like we didnt do a lot of concrete examples. Some of the homeworks were fine, some were much harder. The tests were fine except for a couple difficult parts, but plenty of time for them. The labs could sometimes be really tricky and time consuming and confusing, other times was able to finish during the lab period. But the grading wasnt harsh for them which was nice",
          "The weekly labs and homework were fairly time consuming but overall the material wasn't too bad.",
          "This class was actually a lot of fun. Labs feel a little unguided and above your level at first (because they are) but as the weeks go by it gets a lot easier to pick up the skills that are required for them. Nick is really helpful, so ask for help all the time; this gives him an opportunity to tell you things about the lab (which might be helpful to be in the lab, but any way you can get it, do). Lecture was actually quite enjoyable, and Prof. Zhang is a good instructor. Somehow he manages to avoid a lot of the tedium associated with the \"sitting around watching a professor solve problems\" style of lecture in a very problem-oriented course. I didn't feel like lecture dragged on or were pointless, and he is very clear about what are the concepts we needed to take away from the class.",
          "The labs can be frustrating sometimes, but Nick is so helpful.",
          "The lectures do a good job at covering the theory, though for problem solving more practice is definitely needed outside of class. The labs were interesting and challenging. Office hours were very important as small errors in the labs could take a very long time to fix.",
          "Great course",
          "Professor Zhang's lectures were helpful and he did many helpful examples, although sometimes they were hard to understand. The lab component is challenging but helpful- you will probably need to go to office hours to complete them. The exams and quizzes were fair, make sure you understand the homeworks.",
          "The labs of the course are very engaging and Nick is very helpful. Overall good course.",
          "The lab portion of this class is pretty great. Nick is a great instructor, although sometimes he's a little too cryptic for my liking. Nick, I'm not asking for help because I want you to do it for me, I'm asking for help because I'm utterly lost and your cryptic answers often do not help at all. Moving on, Hao Zhang, on the other hand, pretty much kills any interest I have in this class. Not only are his slides extremely cluttered and hard to follow, it's just poorly taught. When you combine a weekly homework and labs that you don't finish during the allotted time (because you're totally lost and Nick gives you a non-answer and our TA was obviously instructed to do the same), I find myself spending upwards of 8-11 hours/week on this class OR less than 3. There is no in between, and you never know ahead of time which it'll be.",
          "The labs may take a while, but they give good hands on experience. The class is not too difficult if you pay attention in class and to the examples Prof. Zhang gives. The homework helps with understanding the material.",
          "This class was simultaneously the best and worst class I have ever taken at Northwestern. The class was extremely informative and interesting, as I have never taken a hands on circuits class before, but the workload of the lab portion was absolutely insane.",
          "I actually liked this course more than I thought I would. Hao's teaching takes a little time to adjust to, but I grew to love him throughout the quarter. The labs get really long and challenging as the quarter goes on, so be sure to stay on top of those. I didn't take advantage of the given lab time during class, but I think I would've been much less stressed if I had stayed longer during lab periods. The exams are very straightforward and the labs are graded pretty leniently. Overall, a good course and I learned a ton about circuits without being overly stressed like many other McCormick classes.",
          "I really enjoyed the content of this class. The lab was great and Nick is super helpful. The lecture was a little all over the place but if you focus hard and listen it will make sense. Getting distracted for a short time will make the whole lecture confusing. Class work is a bit much with homework and quiz and labs on Monday. It was frustrating because Prof Huang would not upload the homework until Thursday when we were supposed to have a week to do it.",
          "The lab portion was by far the best thing about this course. The lecture felt like a slightly more in depth re-hash of EA3 and physics 135-2, and I personally felt that most of the same information could be provided through only the lab section with just a few changes. I had never really touched circuits before taking this class, but I learned so much and feel quite confident with circuits now.",
          "The lab was really interesting and somewhat demanding. Prof. Zhang and the TA showed mercy when grading.",
          "I felt that the lectures didn't add that much to the class. I learned from the book and homework assignments. The content isn't particularly hard, and it didn't take that long to learn the concepts. The major portion of this class was the lab, as they proved to be more challenging and time-intensive than other labs I've had at Northwestern.",
          "Sometimes lectures are kind of confusing, but not a bad class overall. Actually super interesting bc I didn't know anything about this topic before this class. Labs can be really frustrating, but Nick is the best!!",
          "Nick the TA has office hours for lab every weekday for two hours and it's extremely helpful, but also sometimes if the lab was particularly hard, it was difficult to get his attention for help. Prof. Zhang was a decent professor, but the slides need so much work, it's hard to follow both in and out of class."

So, it is quite hard to even understand where you are confused, until you get to the homework and realize you have no idea what is going on. As for the labs, Nick Marchuk is a lifesaver. Absolutely fantastic and helpful person. GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS!",

          "I think this course is very challenging, but great at engaging the students. The lecture portion could be improved, a lot of times I was lost on what we were supposed to know and didn't learn it until I did the homeworks. The lab portion was great, I learned a lot.",

Hao is a really nice guy and is funny, and makes fun of his own slides but STILL WONT CHANGE ALL OF THEM OVER TO BETTER SLIDES AHAHAH. Nick ROCKS and will help you understand everything you're doing, rather than just telling you answers. Nick is also an awesome circuit debugger.",
          "This class is pretty nice, as far as junior year BME classes go, but that's not really saying much. Hao is an alright professor, it can be kinda hard to get exactly the information you want from him sometimes when you ask a question. The lab part of class can be hard, but is super informative and feels very practical, especially in the later labs. Nick is dope, very smart, reasonable and easy to talk to.",
          "This is a pretty good introductory circuits class; however, if you've taken any circuits classes before (ME 233\ud87c\udf33, GEN_ENG 295, etc.) the lectures will be mostly review and kinda boring. The labs were really fun, and Nick does a good job at hands-on teaching. The last few weeks of the class get a little abstract so definitely pay attention to that. Lecture slides are a joke, so either read the book or look things up online if you're trying to review the lectures.",
          "This course is doable, but you have to do a lot of the work on your own. Homework assignments aren't bad if you read the book for strategies. Labs aren't too bad, since Nick and the TAs are really willing to help out.",
          "This class was overall very good. The labs were really well-run and helped the class learn a lot. The grading scheme was also very reasonable.",

          "Hao's lectures can be confusing, but the example problems are very helpful if you ask him to slow down. Definitely look at examples out of the book because that is the only way I knew how to do the homework. Labs are very time-consuming but kind of cool.",
          "Prof. Zhang really cares about his students and the course as a whole and it comes off as such when he lectures, which is refreshing compared to another course taken simultaneously with this one *ahem*. He reads the CTECs and legitimately takes it to heart. I hope he puts this message on the slide for CTECs -- I also want to mention the obligatory \"Nick is the man\" (but don't fret, Hao is also the man).",
          "The beginning was not hard and went slowly, but the second half went quickly and was harder.",
          "Lab is kind of fun but you have no clue what you're doing. Prof Hao is one of the worst teachers I've had at NU. Nice guy, but cannot explain the material in a way that is different from reading the textbook, except for his explanations are less complete than the book. The final exam was nothing like we expected either.",
          "Pretty good class. Nick is very helpful for lab. Hao is a pretty good lecturer, but the slides suck. Hao acknowledged that they're bad but refuses to remake them.",
          "I enjoyed being able to apply what we learned in class to build circuits during lab. I also enjoyed working on labs specifically designed for biomedical purposes.",
          "This class was pretty much useless and yet somehow it was made difficult. The content was not hard, it's basically a recap of EA3/Physics2 plus a bit more on circuit diagrams and Op-Amps. The difficulty arose in the terrible lecturing style, the poorly written test questions, and a just general lack of structure. Starting with the lectures, the slides are awful and if the fact that the slides are awful is mentioned then the professor will laugh and say \"they are not his and are from the book so don't complain about them\". He made a point at the beginning of the class that the slides are messy and has gotten many evaluations that cite the uselessness of the slides so I am not sure why he has not taken the time to put together slides that are actually usable. On to the tests, if you don't solve a problem the specific way the prof taught you then you are likely to get a zero for the entire question despite the fact that your method 1) gives the correct answer, 2) is in the book, 3) is buried in the useless slides he insisted on using, and 4) how you did it on the homework where you got full credit, good luck figuring that out. The professor also disappeared during the final and there were no TAs present so good luck if you had questions or were worried about cheating. The labs themselves were pretty straight forward and Nick is really good at helping you get your circuit to work and explain what is going on, which is especially important because lecture is most certainly behind lab because you will spend 2 weeks relearning Kirchoffs Laws for the third time in your NU career and if you took any sort of physics in high school you can probably just skip lecture. In general, if you don't have to take this class don't, there are better circuits classes with more responsible professors at NU.",

          "Great class! Nick is awesome and Prof Zhang is really nice. A little frustrating at times with poor communication regarding hw and last minute changes, but overall pretty straightforward and definitely teaches you a lot.",
          "Professor Zhang is a great guy who's very approachable and easy to talk to so it was really easy to get help. He obviously puts effort into teaching. The only issue I had was the lack of coordination between labs and lectures. We started using op-amps in lab weeks before we actually learned what they did in lecture.",
          "As far as a mandatory BME class goes, this isnt too bad. The grade is very evenly split between homework, quizzes, labs, and exams. Lecture can feel a bit aimless or pointless at times, but it definitely helps for completing the homework. Hao is a solid professor and actually cares about how the class is being received by the students. Nick (head of the lab portion) is a godsend, makes learning the circuits much easier. Loved the hands on portion of this class.",
          "I did not expect myself to be able to do many of the objectives outlined in the labs, but the course taught me a lot and the TAs were extremely helpful in achieving the goal of the lab. Very well put together class.",
          "Overall a great course. You learn a lot. Not the most organized but you can do well if you read the book and do a lot of practice problems. The circuits portion is great! Nick is great!",
          "I wish I could take this class again, definitely one of my favorite classes at Northwestern so far.",
          "A necessary evil. Thought I was done with MATLAB but I was wrong. This class should be for EECS\u02fcomp_Sci majors but for some reason it's a BME class. Steep learning curve so don't get left in the dust. I'm scared for the rest of the sequence",
          "I enjoyed the class. The labs are super cool and practical.",
          "I enjoyed this course. The lecture material was slightly challenging but not ridiculously difficult. The homework assignments and weekly quizzes were a happy medium between easy and impossible and helped to prepare me for the exams. The lab portion of the course was super cool and it felt like the skills we were learning were really applicable. The labs were a little more challenging than the homework, and they required a good bit of work outside of class. That being said NICK (lab instructor) IS A GOD and he will help you through any obstacles you run into.",
          "",
          "",
          "TL;DR Nick is the man. Utilize him as much as you can",
          "This class is challenging but what's great about it is the way grading is distributed so that you get out what you put. Because homework and labs are such a high percent of your grade, if you work hard then you'll both learn a lot and do really well in the class. I thought it was super interesting, and that's from someone who had never touched a circuit before.",
          "The lectures were pointless and all learning was done in your own time with the \"custom\" textbook. The professor marked a whole question wrong on the midterm from the entire class because, despite it being worked out properly via what the textbook stated, it wasnt done the way he wanted.",
          "Fairly easy course if you take the time to go see Marchuk for lab help. \"I just want to be home with my Christmas tree\" - Friends & I while studying for the final",
          "This class was very interesting and very easy to grasp. No prior knowledge was required and the material is taught essentially from the basics. Although Professor Zhang conveys the general concepts of what he is trying to teach well, his lectures can sometimes get hard to follow because he goes very fast when he does problems on the board. Although his powerpoints are cluttered, he takes examples and shows derivations and solves problems on the board, but they are very hard to follow because he goes through them relatively quickly. If you go to class everyday and follow the lecture though, this class is a sure fire A. He isn't trying to trick you; rather, wants you to understand the concept properly and apply it in slightly altered contexts."

The final however was ridiculously hard as the material in the second half of the quarter gets much more difficult. The lab portion of this class is good at teaching how to build circuits, however the labs were very stressful and it was difficult to finish the work during the time. I also feel like the lab instructions were usually unclear which made it even more difficult. Nick was very good at helping out with the labs however.",

          "Very good introduction to a variety of medical imaging modalities. Sahakian is incredibly knowledgable.",
          "This is my favorite engineering course so far at Northwestern. The textbook, while pricey, was extremely well written and worth the money. The material is fascinating. Professor Sahakian is a great professor who explains challenging concepts well and has fair expectations on homework and exams. 10\u2f10.",
          "Overall this is a great course, you learn a lot about many different imaging techniques. The professor does a nice job teaching the class and I am very glad that I took the course.",
          "comprehensive, mostly about physical basis and some electrical details; slides sometimes too abstract, most understood by reading the book",
          "Sahakian is one of the nicest professors I've had and genuinely cares a lot. It's an extremely fair course and I think the workload is practical. The exams are basically exactly what you would expect, I have nothing but good things to say about this course.",
          "I was somewhat disappointed in this course. I didn't really get much out of the lectures, and about the only truly enjoyable part of the course was working on my project. Homeworks seemed a bit unfair given that the lectures didn't really cover problem solving.",
          "Very doable class, exams pretty straightforward. Sahakian has a very soothing voice.",
          "we had a great TA which is what helped make the class more clear. Exams were based on lectures and homework. Overall a very straightforward class that lets us research any medical imaging topic we wanted. Definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in medical technology!",

If you don't understand something, he's really patient and tries to explain it to you in several different ways. The tests are fair and the homework prepares you very well. He sometimes doesn't cover everything on the homework but going to office hours once a week will get you through the homeworks."

The material is very interesting, and Dr. Sahakian is a great guy who makes the material manageable and really cares about how much you learn. He's available, and even willing to take time in class to discuss topics if a few people are having issues. This is a great course to take if you want a course that is not very difficult and are interested in imaging.",

You can also bring in a sheet of paper to the tests so you don't have to memorize everything It can be hard to pay attention in class and know what's important.",
          "I really loved this class!!!!! Super easy - a paper on your choice of topic, weekly hw, a midterm, and a final. All the exams are based on is the hw - so if you understand that, the class is super easy. Simultaneously, I was able to learn a lot about imaging that I thought was significantly more complicated than I could learn, so that was super great as well. Overall, I loved this class and am so happy that I was able to take it!!!!!!",

          "I came into this course really excited about the material and then realized it wasn't for me. It isn't bad but at this point, I am not interested in the subject matter.",
          "I really liked this class and I definitely learned a lot. It wasn't exactly on what I had expected, I thought it would be more about reading medical images than understanding the physics behind medical imaging, but I still enjoyed it. Professor Sahakian is very friendly and you can tell that he wants everyone to learn the material. The exams are fair and the homeworks are manageable. I\u027d recommend taking this for fulfilling BME track electives.",

          "ALAN SAHAKIAN FOR PROFESSOR OF THE DECADE. this guy rocks. he has all custom note-sheets with excerpts from the textbook and from very highly regarded primary reference sources old and new alike. he explains all the concepts super clearly and makes really good analogies that help bring some of the harder concepts to life. the homework assignments are very applicable to the exams and the exams aren't meant to trip you up. THIS CLASS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW ALL ENGINEERING CLASSES SHOULD BE CONDUCTED. This class is learning-focused and if you're at all interested in medical imaging sign up right now.",

Homework load is fairly light, but I ended up retaining a lot of the information presented in class because I just found the course really interesting. Exams are pretty easy too.

Dr Ameer encourages discussion in class, and the class itself is designed on the principles of self-driven learning. We also get to work on case studies with a partner, and this helps a lot to discuss your ideas\u02ffindings with each other. The project is also great to work, and gives you a sense of how tacking a hypothetical tissue engineering problem is.",
          "I would take this course again. While the lectures were sparse, I appreciated how Professor Ameer gave us skills to independently approach tissue engineering problems and the time to research topics that specifically interested us.",
          "I really enjoyed the discussion sessions and also the final project. These both provided good feedback from the class and instructor.",
          "I liked the discussion setup of the course, but I wish the class syllabus was better structured. There were a lot of changes we had to adapt to. This class was fairly challenging for me, as it is my first tissue engineering related course, but I did like that we were tested on what we researched and analyzed through our writeups, rather than memorizing a bunch of information for exams. I've done well so far though, so I would definitely recommend this class if you're looking to do any form of research in this field now or in the future.",
          "Self paced course. I learned as much as I cared to learn.",

          "The case study\u02fdiscussion format of the class is interesting and not overly time consuming in terms of workload. As someone with no prior BME experience, I found the class challenging but very manageable. A lot of learning on your own but not overly stressful. I highly recommend taking this course if you are interested in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",
          "Since the course is discussion based, it is a lot more interesting than if it was just lecture based. Case studies help you apply theoretical knowledge to actual problems in the field of tissue engineering. Dr. Ameer has a vast knowledge about the subject and encourages the students to participate.

          "This class is a discussion based class where each student looks up papers for each week's case study to discuss in class. I felt that I would have learned more if there was a short lecture giving background for each case study before we looked at papers.",
          "Dr. Ameer presents a guideline for each week to guide you to follow and you must do a lot of research yourself. If you do not like little guidance, this course may not be for you as you have to dig into the literature and make sure you can take criticism for your ideas.",
          "The discussion and case study format was a strength of this course as it allowed for the application of knowledge and class discussion.",
          "A repeat of biomaterials with less effort put into it.",
          "No exams",
          "Highly discussion based",
          "This class was a lot different than what I would've thought. It was 2 days a week with discussions about preliminary research on Tuesdays and then discussions again on Thursday. I thought he would've lectured at least one of the days so we\u027d know what to do for the case study. This would've been very helpful because I came in with no background on Tissue Engineering. It took 3 case studies (out of 6) for my partner and I to get the hang of them. We learned to do like 20 minutes of research for Tuesday's discussion and not start writing until Thursday afternoon (they were due on Fridays) because Ameer would give advice on both Tuesday and Thursday class. The proposal project was okay... my group really didn't pull their weight so my partner and I felt pretty burdened. One less case study would have made the proposal process a lot less stressful.",
          "A discussion based course was intriguing, and the class met expectations for the first few weeks. However, the conversations became very similar week to week, and it was not as interesting as I expected.",
          "Good course if you're interested in the topic or as an elective. The final project is a nice way of applying the knowledge acquired during the quarter while developing a novel idea.",
          "very good class but is a little intimidating as an undergrad.",
          "Case studies were interesting but not necessarily that useful for learning broadly about the topic of tissue engineering. The course was not well structured and a lot of time felt wasted due to that fact.",
          "Interesting class but too many grad students. It\u2019s hard to produce work on their level and the TA doesn\u2019t seem to take your grade level into account.",
          "Somewhat hard to jump into if you don't have a strong tissue engineering background, there aren't really lectures since it's all case studies and discussions based off a weekly prompt so if you don't have a strong background on basic tissue engineering there is a somewhat steep learning curve at the beginning. But Prof. Ameer answers all questions, even basic ones, very thoroughly without judgment and is always helping us to succeed and understand the material instead of just writing a document to turn in. If you are disciplined enough to read a lot of papers and retain the information, this class will be easy. Otherwise, it will be rough for a few weeks, but the case studies and the midterm / final presentations and papers aren't terribly difficult."

          "Absolutely loved this class. Felt extremely relevant without beating the students into the ground as we've seen before.",
          "Dr. Mrksich is incredibly knowledgable and interested in the material, which makes for a great classroom environment. He also provides a lot of information without assigning tons of homework, which was much appreciated. The big grades are two papers, and they really just require thoughtful effort and attention towards what's expected. All in all, great class.",
          "This was one of my favorite classes this quarter. Mrkisch is AWESOME! Super funny and laidback, but knows what he is talking about. Learned a lot and the two big assignments for the quarter were actually pretty fun to do. I like how the class not only talked about biosensor technology, but we discussed how labs form companies from this technology.",
          "Good class; Professor Mrksich is super helpful and enthusiastic about the course, which is really cool since he is so established in the field. He's so clearly knowledgable about start-ups and the new technologies developing, so you can really learn a lot from the course if you put your head to it.",
          "great course! Must take! The whole grade is two papers. You learn a lot and Mrksich is amazing",
          "This course does more than teach you about biosensors. It also teaches you about the start-up field and companies relating to biosensor technologies.",
          "This class was fascinating, and helped me learn a lot not only about biosensors but also about business in medical technology in general. The only two assignments were papers, and they helped me gain a better understanding of what is currently being worked on in the field. I highly recommend this class.",
          "GREAT class. Mrksich is so great. He made me want to come to lecture. 2 interesting assignments throughout the quarter but no exam!!!!!",
          "This was a really cool class! I enjoyed learning about how the science behind biosensors can be translated into a commercial company. Very different from the typical engineering class in that you don't really have to memorize any of the content, but you will still learn a lot and have the opportunity to synthesize that knowledge through writing papers. The final paper is critiqued by a panel of your peers, which was an interesting set-up (meant to mirror NIH, etc.) I would recommend having the panel earlier in the quarter (week 7 or 8), then giving students the chance to edit their papers.",
          "Easy, interesting BME Elective A requirement, Mrksich is awesome",
          "Great class! Definitely pretty easy for an Option A elective. The panel at the end is kinda weird but it's not too bad so don't worry too much. He always has the option to give pop quizzes but didn't do that this year. Go to class there's no reason not to because it's actually pretty interesting!",
          "This course is an excellent 300+ level class. It's not a lot of busywork or assignments, but Prof. Mrksich provides a lot of exposure to biosensor technologies, the seminal papers that led to their development, and the process of commercializing them. He also gives a lot of access to information for people interested in being more involved in the biotechnology space after graduation, whether that is in the process of starting a company as a research fellow or working in industry to incubate these companies. In general he's an engaging professor who takes his work seriously and himself/the institution not so terribly seriously, which makes his lectures fun to attend. If you took orgo 210-1 with him and enjoyed the class atmosphere there, this class is no different (but without the exams).",
          "A breadth of biosensor topics is covered in this course. Overall, excellent elective, not very time consuming and you learn a lot.",
          "The papers are reasonable especially you you don't wait till the last minute, and it's nice to not have any tests so what you learn in lecture is just informative then. We didn't even have any pop quizzes which surprised me",
          "This class topic was not interesting to me at all, so it was pretty boring. Mrksich is cool though. Basically just 2 assignments and no final.",
          "Overall this was a good course. The format is different from other lecture classes, and there were a number of guest lecturers who each had an interesting perspective on biotech in general.",
          "This class is very cool to learn about the different biosensors. I wish we could have more hands-on experiences of the actual sensors though. There are two big assignments. They are on 3-4 pages, but they require quite a bit of research. So, start them early. Overall, the class is fine!"

          "Racket is a very odd programming language, but it provides a good framework to learn and/or review the basics of computer science and programming.",
          "Loved the class. One of the best I've taken this quarter. Sometimes the material can be a little dry, but Ian makes it fun and interesting!",
          "Great course for everyone... when if you know programming from before.",
          "It was very hard",
          "This course was chill and a nice break from the other typical high-pressure fast-paced engineering classes. Ian was a great instructor and there were so many TA's that grading was always done fast and there was always someone to answer any questions. The use of Piazza helped a lot as well. My only experience with programming was Matlab and R and I still found this course very well paced and easy to comprehend. I do wish we learned some more imperative programming languages like C or Java, but learning functional programming through Racket has it's merits.",
          "I think having access to so many TAs was very helpful, and learning a new coding language through this class wasn't that difficult.",
          "Coming in with no experience in computer science, I did fairly well in this class. The Quizzes/midterms were much easier than the actual homework exercises. I learned the most from the tutorial sessions. Make sure you understand how to do the homework exercises as many of them are very long and take a long time to finish. Lots of office hours available. Though Racket is not a very useful language, I would definitely recommend to anyone else who has no experience in computer science to start with this class.",
          "Material is good. Coding language is kind of annoying and I have heard that we don't use it much going forward, but was very effective in teaching us basic concepts. The lectures were a little bland and I felt like I didn't have much motivation to go, which affected my learning.",
          "Racket was a weird language but I think it built my program thinking. Ian is cool but I was able to learn by not going to class and just reading off the lecture slides. The most learning happened during tutorials and through homework.",
          "This is an easy course if you're ready to spend some time understanding the logic behind coding. Good intro class! Ian is a great professor, really fun!",
          "The content was rather easy to learn and understand, but the homework was either very easy or very hard depending on how well you understand the covered topics and how deep the application of the concepts was. I overall enjoyed the course and Ian is a great professor who knows what he's teaching. The quizzes given are pretty easy compared to the homework.",
          "I loved the professor and the way the course is organized (1 assignment per week and 3 quizzes).",
          "This class is hard and takes a lot of work. Lecture wasn't too useful at all, go to as many office hours as you can.",
          "This class is good to further your knowledge on Dr. Racket. Lectures are pretty much the slides, so attending class isn't necessary.",
          "the course is okay, but programming in racket is annoying. I don't recommend taking this class if you don't have to.",
          "I really liked this course. It was difficult for me being a beginner, but Ian was a really great instructor and the undergrad TAs were amazing. The assignments were structured so that you had enough time to get help if you needed it and ensure that you were doing it right. It's a little irritating that Racket is not actually used in the real world, but I understand the logic behind using a teaching language. Definitely not an easy class (for me anyway) but still very manageable to get a good grade. I probably would not have passed this class without going to the TAs' office hours; Sasha, Shane, and Will were super helpful.",
          "The professor was good, but the language itself, Racket, is dumb.",
          "Racket is really frustrating if you're used to Java or really any other language, but Ian is a great teacher, and the quizes are fair (make sure to familiarize yourself with the format ahead of time). All in all, EECS 111 is a good class, but could be better if the language it used wasn't so annoying at times.",
          "Needs more assessments, only had one quiz grade before reading week.",
          "Learnt a lot in this course. Not too hard.",
          "The course is not very time-consuming, and Ian is a great professor. TA discussions are very interactive and helpful. Homeworks can be difficult especially for a beginner programmer like myself. Paying attention in lectures is important to success. The beginning of the course is very easy and will catch you off guard because it gets much more difficult.",
          "Lectures were kind of boring, but the homeworks were really interesting and that was really where the learning happened.",
          "Supposedly, the language is difficult to understand. There are many frustrating things about this class, especially if you haven't coded before. But the TAs are great, especially Sarah, and the teacher is helpful. If you want to learn the \"logic\" of coding, a helpful class.",
          "If you don't have a background in programming, this is not a course for you. It really doesn't teach foundations for beginners - it teaches important topics for people who already have a strong background in programming. This class leaves people behind to fail. For instance the final exam - yeah, over 70 people got less than half of the problems right, but because most of the class is CS majors who have seen this stuff before, the mean was an 80% and over 100 people got an A on the exam. Additionally, some of the peer mentors (basically TAs) will make you feel stupid for not getting concepts and then they'll insinuate that you're wasting their time and the time of your classmates by going to office hours. But really it's just because this class is for people who are serious about programming, or at least that's how they look at it.",
          "I loved Ian's lectures, they were interesting and had a lot of background information about computer science (which some may not like). Overall the course isn't too hard and is manageable if you pay half-attention during lecture and understand the hw codes.",
          "Wasn't too interested. Racket isn't a very nice language.",
          "Really enjoyable class. Great intro class for not only CS majors but anyone interested in programming. Ian makes the information accessible to all students and really encourages everyone to do well in the class. TA's are a hit or miss. Head TA's know exactly what they're doing but some other TA's have no idea what they're doing.",
          "Was a good overall class.",
          "This course was fantastic at teaching basic computer science techniques, but the language was utterly useless.",
          "Ian Horswill is awesome, but lectures did not really help with learning the material. Also Racket is not a good language.",
          "Ok class, find people to work with you, programming concepts same as others.",
          "I felt that the course could have been taught in a less abstract way since the professor often times really abstracted or went off on tangents. The lectures seemed to be a little boring, especially near the end and that did not help. Perhaps if there were examples questions given in class or even just physically writing code in front of us could have been more useful. Other than that, the office hours were bountiful and spread out which was very useful and the tutorials were useful resources for understanding how to do certain topics like recursion or imperative programming.",
          "I didn't really learn what I expected to, and I feel like it didn't make me very excited about programming. The material was very mildly interesting, and not too hard. I did learn some concepts which I now understand are applicable to all languages, but I think the class could be improved.",
          "The tests were fair, the exercises were difficult and there were too many of them (why was one due during finals week?), and Ian was cool",
          "excellent introduction of computer science concepts. There are people who whine and complain that Racket's useless, but as someone who's taken two comp sci classes before this, I can say that it is an excellent survey of fundamental CONCEPTS in computer science, which is very important because this knowledge will carry over when you're trying to learn other programs.",
          "Interesting course overall, but not super useful just because we use Racket.",
          "Learned tons without putting in a whole lot of effort. Honest attendance is enough to get most any student through, Ian is great but can move a little slow. Easy tests, overall a great class",
          "This was a very solid introduction to programming. Prof. Horswill is a very clear lecturer and very willing to answer questions. This class will be fairly simple if you took AP Comp Sci or have other programming experience. If anything, you will gain a better grasp on recursion.",
          "Great class. I mostly learned through homework. Tests were really easy. Ian is a great professor. Lectures are interesting but definitely not necessary to do well in the class.",
          "The course should have been taught in a more applicable computer language such as Python or C++ as they are much more useable in jobs later on than Racket.",
          "Very disappointed with this class. I'm a computer science major, so this class is required, but I was not happy at all. The language we used, Racket, is a waste of time and useless in the real world. If you have no programming experience it's probably helpful to learn concepts like recursion, but as someone who already knew all the concepts taught in this class, it was very hard to motivate myself to relearn these concepts in a useless language that is literally never used outside of this class.",
          "Good",
          "The first few weeks were easy since we didn't really get any homework and the homework exercises were easy. However, at around week 5 or 6 everything got SUPER hard, especially if you started to relax and take it easy since you thought the first few weeks were easy. Basically, don't fall behind and you should be fine.",
          "The homework assignments were very difficult and I wish the course was a bit more practical and was taught in a language commonly used. The quizzes were not too bad though",
          "If you want to learn programming, this is to the course. Do one on a particular language. However, it's an easy A and a moderately interesting class.",
          "This class made me want to be a computer science major.",
          "Great class for learning about computer science concepts.",
          "It was labeled as a beginner class but as a student coming out of AP computer science it still felt extremely difficult.",
          "Ian tends to go really slow on the easy concepts and really fast on the harder concepts, the course can be initially really really hard for someone who has had zero programming experience. The programs are really, really difficult to do after the first few, but the quizzes are definitely doable if you practice a lot of problems and you know what kinds of problems to look out for.",
          "This class is great to take if you want to figure out if you like coding or not. Overall easy but also challenging (the assignments could be hard and not well explained)",
          "The course did focus on all the topics it was supposed to.",
          "The programming language used in this course initially did not feel too comfortable too use, so even if you've programmed in the past, there's a period of adjustment needed before you acclimate to the rhythm of the course. The class itself, however, is really not asking too much. If you just complete the weekly assignments and attend the tutorial sessions, the class should not slay you. For new programmers though, there's likely going to be a learning curve, although office hours and Sunday recitations (where a TA goes over and reviews material covered in the past week's lecture) should be sufficient to help you stay on track.",
          "I think this is a good class but I think they need to rethink how it is taught. I feel completely unprepared to do the homeworks and rely solely on office hours to complete them. Also, TAs should have access to the homework answers because often times they won't know an answer to a homework problem either. Homeworks should either be easier or be worth more because they take up so much time.",
          "I had heard that this class would be easy with prior programming experience, but that was definitely not the case. I never learned anything in lecture, and the \"quizzes\" were too difficult given that there was basically no way to study for them besides the practice quiz.",
          "Course and instructor are interesting, but the language we use is disgusting.",
          "Didn't offer enough resources for learning outside of class, Ian was a good professor though.",
          "Ian is an engaging lecturer and the material is interesting. If you are familiar with programming this class won't be too difficult but there is still enough new information to make it worth your time.",
          "Tutorials were a waste of time and should be optional; they're only useful for students who are struggling and need extra support. Homework was way too easy due to the excessive amount of handholding (i.e., guidance and work already done for us). Since very little theory is introduced in this class, it's pretty much just a course that covers writing basic programs. As such, it would make so much more sense to work with a more useful and widely applicable programming language like Python instead of Racket. All in all, I don't see why EECS 111 exists. I took EECS 110 last year, and it was a far better course and could certainly replace 111 in my opinion.",
          "lol.",
          "Racket seemed like a bad language to start out in, I was lost for a lot of it",
          "The language used in this class is by far the strangest I have ever seen and I'm not a huge fan. That being said, it's not too difficult to pick up on, the syntax is just strange.",
          "The class is as interesting as a class taught for a 200-person lecture hall can ever be. Ian is engaging, friendly, very funny and brilliant, and the material is well designed. The assignments are fun enough to do that I legitimately look forward to doing my homework. The only complaints I have are the complete lack of individual attention that is inevitable in a massive lecture hall, and which makes participation effectively impossible for anyone who isn't lunatically brave. However, be warned that this class teaches in a useless programming language because it communicates concepts very well, which is a cool thing for the long haul and I've heard pays off wonderfully for the major eventually, but is a bit frustrating since you can't do all that much in the real world until like three classes from now.",
          "This was not my most favorite class. It's difficult to learn coding quickly and effectively, so this class required, at least for me, going to any and all office hours to complete the homeworks.",
          "Don't try to study for this class alone. It can be confusing. Go to office hours and find classmates to work through practice tests.",
          "Have to put in the work to do the exercises and the quizzes are rather difficult",
          "The homework was really important. It really helped me learn. I wish I would have taken it more seriously.",
          "Only take it if you have to. I was excited to learn to code but this isn't the class for that. This is the class where everyone is passing code along (probably taken from the 1% who knows what they are doing or has coded a lot before). The lectures and tutorials DO NOT prepare you for the homework. Also, the student TAs have less of an idea of what is going on than the current students. The only time they are ever helpful is when they just feed you code. worst class ever.",
          "This class is not introductory. The homework assignments are long and difficult, and lectures are confusing at best for someone who has little to no exposure to computer science. The language is obscure and the assignments are so stressful that I was doing them only for the grade not to learn the material because I felt pressed for time always.",
          "The homework is really hard and will take up a lot of your time. In comparison the quizzes are extremely easy. Lecture is not that helpful if you are someone who is easily distracted because its not very engaging.",
          "DrRacket is annoying to learn if you took AP Computer Science in high school and learned Java or a different language. Ian is a good professor and his slides are understandable, but usually they are easier to comprehend than the exercise programs that are due each week. Having a good TA is essential to asking questions about these exercises.",
          "This course was very fun. Ian is a wonderful speaker and engages you strongly when teaching the course. As someone who has done computer programming for years, I did not learn many new ideas about programming during this course, but it was a good and engaging refresher course on basic computer programming.",
          "The homework assignments for this class were so very difficult for me, however there were many office hours posted and the quizzes were not that bad.",
          "This class seems really easy at first, but then it gets you real quick. Ian teaches well, but he teaches at more of a conceptual level. The tutorials were great for applying the concepts.",
          "Pretty challenging if you don't know anything about CS, lectures do not help to clarify anything. Make friends to study and figure out homework with, otherwise you will never be able to do well.",
          "I was super rusty with my coding skills and it brought me back up to speed. The usage of Racket as the language really levels the playing field so that people who don't have much experience with programming can do as well as the people who have a lot of experience. It was a fun course and I\u027d recommend it to nonmajors because if you like puzzle-solving, you'll probably like coding. Also, you can ask for an extension every week, which really helped spread out my workload.",
          "Don't take it without a friend.",
          "Ian is the best professor ever.",
          "Ian was a pretty good prof. Exercises and tests weren't too bad, there are a lot of TAs so lots of opportunities for office hours but also some are hit-or-miss. A strange mix between moving too slow for the coding-experienced and too fast for the non-experienced, though.",
          "SO HARD OMG IF YOU DONT LIKE COMPUTER SCIENCE!!! DO NOT TAKE THIS AS A DISTRO!!!! OMG!!!!",
          "Ian was a great prof. The Exercises do get pretty tough so thats annoying but the quizzes were easy.",
          "This is a great course to get an introduction to functional programming\u02fcomputer science. The professor and TAs make themselves very open to helping you. The work is manageable and the topics range in difficulty.",
          "Professor Horswill explains the material quite well. The class itself does get progressively difficult, and the homework assignments can be difficult. The quizzes are a lot easier. There are a lot of TA's in this course, but most of them were not helpful at all during office hours. They were very under-prepared and would often not do the course work themselves. Overall, you should expect to do more work than the course number would suggest, but it's an interesting class nonetheless.",
          "Easy course if you have background in the subject. If not, racket can be really confusing at times.",
          "Racket definitely is not the most fun language to work with. It is not nearly as intuitive as many other languages are, and i saw more than one friend drop out of the course because it was taught in a strange language.",
          "Racket seemed like a useless language, but a lot of the topics are similar to higher-ended programming.",
          "It is like a nice introduction.",
          "As a Kellogg student, this class is great.",
          "This is a good class for people who have never programmed before... and those people only. The department must waive this class for students who have taken AP CS already. Using an esoteric language like Dr. Racket does NOT '\u027even the playing field'' for people who understand programming... it just annoys people who dislike Scheme. Personally, EECS 111 was a waste of my time. The AP class was far more challenging. If you can program and have to take this class for a requirement, here's some advice: skip lecture and use that time to build side projects.",
          "I knew the material before the course, making it a breeze. Almost a waste of my time. But I feel like this class is a good introduction to people who are new at programming. It would have been helpful for me like 3 years ago.",
          "The course was very well designed for an intro course, it was thorough and went through all the fundamentals.",
          "The main coding language in this class is challenging, but places emphasis on the foundations of coding",
          "This course is a well-structured introduction to programming. The lectures are huge, but they try to compensate that with small tutorial sessions. Lecture was often dry, but the class is definitely manageable.",
          "Having no past experience in programming, I greatly enjoyed this course. I took it purely to see what the class is about. However, it is an introductory class and I was disappointed that most students already had copious amounts of prior knowledge.",
          "It definitely made me want to enroll in more EECS courses and learn more about the discipline.",
          "Ian is a great guy and great professor, this course is not too challenging or time consuming.",
          "Very very easy to fall behind",
          "Decent class that would be totally doable for first-time coders. Pretty much all review for people who have taken AP Comp Sci so not that challenging. Weekly projects don't take too much time and there's an army of TA's so lots of help available",
          "PROS: Racket language is fun, Fun assignments (video game!), Learn a lot, Easy quizzes.",
          "CONS: Time consuming weekly assignments. They take about 4-9 hours to do. TAs are not that helpful. Discussion/tutorial is useless but you have to go anyway.",
          "OVERALL: This class is meh. If I could go back in time, I would probably not take it. For the most part, you learn a lot but the class is quite tedious. Towards the second half of the class, I never went to lecture at all and could still complete the assignments and do somewhat well on quizzes. ONLY TAKE IT IF YOU NEED IT FOR THE MAJOR!",
          "The lecture and exam material is relatively easy, but there is a huge discrepancy when one compares it to what is on the homework programs, which can get unnecessarily hard, in my opinion.",
          "I thought it was odd that they put a mix of people with and without coding experience into the same class. The new language of DrRacket (which is kind of the worst, different from most languages you'll encounter) kind of levels the playing field, but having a programming mindset still helps. The lectures however aren't too intense, and the tutorials are relaxed and especially helpful if you have a good TA.",
          "You get what you put into this class. If you do your own work and go to class, you will do well. It's really easy to slack off, but it's even easier to do well if you just show up and do your own work.",
          "A good first computer science class. Gives a foundation for a variety of concepts. Lectures aren't always focused and could be more clear but overall not a super hard class.",
          "Prof. Ian is amazing. I really like the way he teach. The course is not very hard but stimulate your interest in programming.",
          "not the best class but I had a great TA and I like coding.",
          "This course was relatively confusing to me. Instead of simply teaching a programming language it taught the conceptual side of programming. Probably a great course for programmers looking to learn about a different side of CS. As a first time programmer, I found this course really difficult. There was a lot of computing jargon that just did not make sense to me.",
          "Pay attention to where the parenthesis go!",
          "I came into this class knowing absolutely nothing about computer programming and I learned so much! It really allows you to build your knowledge from the ground up without feeling pressured. The TAs are so friendly and office hours have saved my life time and time again.",
          "The most impotant thing to me was learning to think differently",
          "Lots of homework",
          "I wanted to see if I enjoyed coding and if it was potentially something I would like to pursue and it is",
          "Horswill does a great job of keeping students entertained during lectures. Heard Sood is easier, but definitely no complaints about Horswill.",
          "Good introduction class to coding, Racket gets a little annoying at times.",
          "Assignments can be nice challenges. Lectures are kind of boring but what can you expect from a 300 person class?",
          "Certain concepts were incredibly hard, however, the vast majority was too simple.",
          "The course was extremely tough, but helped me learn a good amount about computer programming",
          "It was a very challenging class. The lectures did not make sense and the homework programs took forever to complete.",
          "Do not take this class with Horsewill, He is not a good lecturer and he does not care about how his students do in the class. The assignments were confusing and not a good reflection of the material.",
          "Overall, the tests weren't too bad, if you study the practice tests and his slides you'll do fine. Also, even though the exercises are challenging they really do help in understanding how the procedures apply to a language. There's also A LOT of office hours available so you can get help to do your homework. Take advantage of them!",
          "This is a great intro to programming class. If you are even considering Comp sci as a minor take this class to see if you like it. For assignments, go to TA office hours they are extremely helpful!!",
          "It is a nice course for introduction into programming",
          "I took this course to see if I would be interested in computer science, but unfortunately, this course was not structured in a way that helped me realize if I cs is something that I would like to pursue or not. I felt as though I was struggling to keep up with the students who already had cs experience.",
          "The coding language learned is not really relevant to languages used in the world today so that was disappointing. But I did have a lot of fun in this class as I was learning the design process and that would be able to transfer over to other languages which would help me a lot in the future.",
          "Not too hard of a course and learned a lot about programming.",
          "Racket is quite a pain to learn.",
          "A fantastic intro to computer programming. Don't take that to mean it's easy, though. Definitely one of the harder courses I took this quarter.",
          "I enjoyed this course. Ian is a pretty good teacher and a pretty chill guy and clearly has a love for programming. The work load isn't bad at all: just one exercise per week due every Friday (you can get an extension until Sunday any and every week if you choose) and a one hour \"tutorial\" session at whatever time you choose during the week (I would recommend earlier in the week because it sometimes helps with the exercises). While I and most others don't love the Racket language or at least its syntax (Parentheses. Parentheses everywhere.), I can understand why it is used to teach us the basics. The fact that this course dealt with such a low-level language helped me to better understand concepts like recursion that you wouldn't encounter in other higher-level languages such that have loops and other things programmed in and what not. All in all, I would recommend this class to anyone taking this course who has an interest in learning to program as a discipline and is still useful even if you are planning on only learning a single language for whatever reason. Previous programming experience is certainly not required, though it does help of course.",
          "I learned a lot, but failed to see the usefulness of learning the language DrRacket",
          "A fine course!",
          "I thought the course was interesting and was really impressed by the amount of resources that this course had. I was able to get help in SOOO many different ways which was really comforting and helpful. Lectures did not help in understanding the course though.",
          "The lectures do not help with me trying to learn. If you don't learn well through just being lectured then this class is not for you. Also the TAs are snakes because a lot of them were not at their office hours",
          "Having already coded before, this class was very frustrating. The pace seemed slower than an average class and I don't think that it would provide that great an understanding of coding or the logic behind it had I never coded before. There wasn't much emphasis on how to approach problems or solve them as much as explaining how to do simple tasks in a language that doesn't have much practical use (Dr. Racket). The tests were not a reflection of one's ability to write or even understand code as much as they were how well you could memorize the syntax patterns for Dr. Racket",
          "The language is kind of annoying at times, but pretty basic. The TAs are helpful if you go to office hours--in my opinion, the lectures weren't very helpful, but a lot of people thought they were. Overall, this course is very helpful for gauging whether or not programming is a good match for you.",
          "Easy if you have computer science background, would NOT recommend if you do not and are looking for a place to learn CS.",
          "It was a hard course, especially for someone with no CS experience",
          "I enjoyed learning about the fundamental, abstract ideas of the course but I wish we had learned a more useful and applicable language than Racket. I did not find the lectures to be entirely helpful either.",
          "good course, pretty well organized",
          "111 is a great intro class. Although DrRacket may seem silly sometimes, it is a very simple, straight to point language to learn. It was my first time learning programming but if you follow the class and do exercise on your own, you will be able to pull it off and learn a lot.",
          "If you haven't programmed before, DO NOT take this class unless you have someone to act as your personal tutor. The homework could be impossible at times. But, if you get the concepts, the quizzes are fair.",
          "Great class, racket not used that much but it does provide you with a good foundation.",
          "the tutorials are where i learned most",
          "I enjoyed the course. Racket is not my favorite language but it was definitely an interesting perspective.",
          "This class will be difficult if you have no prior coding experience. Take it if you have to, but it may be an overload if you want to take it as an elective. DrRacket is such an odd programming language.",
          "I think this is a well done intro class, the sheer army of TA's and tutorial sessions mean help is always at the ready and you still get to learn hands on in small groups",
          "EECS 111 was by far my hardest class this quarter. I do not know if it was the teaching or if it was the material. I could not understand why codes were written how they were and even spending hours trying to study and learn and practice the code myself, it was infuriating. I also strongly disliked the language of Racket as well. It doesn't seem applicable anywhere but in class.",
          "This course is manageable. Lectures are not mandatory. If you have a background in programming, just follow up on the content through lecture slides. Spend time on the assignments and check them, double check them, triple check them. Take your time on the quizzes. 3 quizzes, each 25 % of your final grade, last quiz cumulative.",
          "This course is difficult but taught the fundamentals of programming.",
          "Racket is a very irritating language. Ian is cool and the tutorial system is a great way to get one on one help when you need it and brush up on things you learned during lecture.",
          "THIS CLASS IS A TRAP DON'T TAKE IT UNLESS YOU PLAN TO BE COMP SCI MAJOR OR HAVE EXPERIENCE IN CODING! NOT FOR PEOPLE NEW TO CODING I REPEAT! THIS IS A TRAP!",
          "This course is not for beginners. Unless you have a ton of coding experience, you will fail in this class unless you have someone to copy homework from. The lectures don't prepare you for the homeworks, and the homeworks don't prepare you for the tests. It's a huge mess that will screw you over. Most of the ta's don't know what's going on either and are more confused than you are. Ian also is not the most understanding guy.",
          "The class, despite being taught in a language that is not applicable outside of the class, does help people who do not have coding experience like me gain a fundamental understanding of the rationale and thought process behind coding. The class is not very difficult and the work isn't excessive. That said, there is basically no curve for the class because everyone does super well.",
          "It was a perfect introduction to computer programming. Very easy and entertaining, but you still learn a lot.",
          "Great class, Ian makes his instructions very clear on all assignments and lecture slides to help facilitate learning outside of class. Assignments were occasionally hard and takes a bit of time. Exams are very straight forward."

          "The class was incredibly fast-paced and hard to keep up with- especially the homework. I spent hours working on codes and the homework was very challenging. The tests were much easier than the homework and really focused on the crucial aspect of the language that you needed to know. I felt behind from most of my class because I did not have coding experience.",
          "I do feel like I learned, but I only learned through the lab section and the homework, never the lectures. They would often go too fast and the professor would not explain things very well. Also, Racket is not a very good beginning language because there is nothing else like Racket in the real world. Lastly, the partner system was awful. I ended up doing nearly all of the work on all of the assigned partner homeworks and it was incredibly difficult to find time that my partner and I could 'work' together. When we were able to choose our partners, that helped a lot.",
          "I learned the most from doing the homework, although the partner system needs improvement. Lectures were fast passed and hard to follow. Overall not to bad if you're willing to put in the time on assignments.",
          "This course was hard, especially with Professor Tov teaching it. He went over so many things and the TAs were extremely helpful.",
          "Winter and Spring quarters are completely different in the overall structure. This year, 2018, the Winter class focused on list processing and data stuff but barely touched GUI and state based game logic. Spring on the other hand had the opposite approach. Making games is a lot of fun however I'm told that 211 builds more on the Winter quarter skill set.",
          "Jesse Too teaches this class at a high level, including the homework being challenging and the lectures covering challenging material. The lectures were very hard to follow as the professor usually just drones on and codes for the entire hour and 20 minutes. You are expected to do over 25 pages of reading a night.",
          "Don't get scared away by the homework, that's the hardest part of the whole class.",
          "Overall, this course gave a good introduction to the principles of functional programming. However, it could have been good if it used a more popular program language instead of Racket, since Racket is rarely used in programming. A language like Python could be a much better alternative.",
          "Homework was extremely hard, tests were easier. If you want this to be an easy class don\u2019t take it with tov.",
          "The course is one in which you get pout of it what you put into it.",
          "Hard class for sure, and not a walk in the park even if you've coded before. Expect to put in 8+ hours later in the course on programs.",
          "I found this course challenging, and it took way more of my time and effort than I wanted considering I had to take it because I am a neuroscience major, and I don't plan on taking another computer science class. The homework assignments are incredibly difficult and time consuming, so make sure you start as early as you can and go to office hours.",
          "Jesse is a good professor and a good teacher as long as you are paying attention in class. Jesse's 111 has a reputation for being way harder than either of the other 111 sections, but if you pay attention and don't fall behind, it ends up being super worth it because you cover so much more interesting stuff in his class than in either of the others.",
          "I get the feeling Jesse cares about teaching and wants to do well, but the lectures are simply ineffective. Not overly difficult, but is more difficult than the other sections of 111.",
          "NOT a good INTRODUCTORY Computer Science course for beginners!! Take the other intro class first, or do NOT take 111 with JESSE if you have less than a major interest in computer science. It is kind of a filter class. If you really like computer science, you will enjoy the class.",
          "God",
          "I didn't love this course. I get that we're supposed to be \"learning how to program\" instead of learning racket, but I feel it would be more useful to learn a language that we might use again if we're going to continue in programming.",
          "This course is difficult but you learn a ton. If you've heard that Jesse's class is harder than Sara or Ian's that is 100% true so be prepared for a class that is a very obvious step up in difficulty from the other professors. If you're taking 111 for a low time-commitment easier intro class take it with a different instructor. That being said, we definitely learned more in this class than we otherwise would have. GO TO LECTURE. Jesse posts all his code from lecture but it's really hard to follow them if you don't have a reference point from going to class. Lab sections are good to brush up on stuff from the week that doesn't make sense. We have a homework program due every week that range a lot in difficulty. The harder ones can take upwards of 7ish hours. Don't think I would have passed this class without office hours, some of the programs are so hard if you can't talk with someone who knows what they're doing. The homework programs are definitely harder than the exams in my opinion. First exam is really easy and the average is super high, second one is quite a bit harder and definitely requires a lot more studying. Overall I really liked this class. You learn a TON and finishing the programs is really rewarding but it's not a class that you can do well in with minimal effort. TLDR: If you want an easy 111 take with Sara or Ian, if you want to learn more take it with Jesse.",
          "As others have said, Tov is definitely harder than the other EECS 111 professors, but he honestly helped me learn on my own. Much of this class relies on making connections on your own and learning by doing. Although Tov's style isn't for everyone, I can definitely say that I learned in this course. Also, the exams are less complicated than the homework, so just be sure to confidently understand what every type of function does and you should be fine.",
          "I learned to code solely because of this course",
          "Everyone says that the class with Tov is the most difficult 111 class. That is true if you have no previous CS experience. If you do have CS experience, taking the class with Tov will not seem that difficult.",
          "Kinda boring and fairly easy, but I don't think it should be made any harder.",
          "The class is not as bad as other people make it sound. If you do all the homeworks properly, the midterms shouldn't be a problem. Also, do make use of the peer TA hours, it's really helpful!",
          "Racket is a useless language. This course is redundant and useless for EECS majors.",
          "oh oh oh oh and this bird you cannot change",
          "Lots of people did not pay attention during the lectures, but I found it helpful, even though Jesse can go over things pretty fast at times. However, most of the learning can be done through doing the homework and going over the notes posted for each class session.",
          "There is a learning curve to this course, especially with Jesse. He moves very quickly in lecture and it's difficult to follow along if you try to type along with him. I recommend doing to reading outside of class if you can, then downloading the lecture notes (he puts all notes online) and follow along with him. Try to focus on his explanations and how that's translated into the code. Jesse genuinely cares about his students and wants you guys to learn, he's just a little hard to follow at times, so try to follow along as best you can and ask questions when you're confused. He's good about leaving time for questions. Good luck!",
          "This course is harder than expected, especially with Jesse Tov. The exams aren't hard, but the homeworks can be. There's also quizzes at the beginning of every class that are pass\u2ffail that are sometimes hard.",
          "Overall the course provides a good introduction to programming and an understanding of the programming design process.",
          "This class is really challenging and hard to follow. It can be difficult to pay attention in class, so make sure to take notes on paper or on the program. The homeworks are difficult and challenging, but if you get started early and go to office hours they are doable. Overall, I ended up learning a lot from the class, even though it was hard to realize it during the class.",
          "Study for the tests, Jesse is really tough",
          "This class moves fast, definitely difficult if you have no programing experience. If you don't have experience you might want to take it with a different teacher.",
          "People complain about the teaching style of this class, but I think it actually one of the best-taught classes I have taken thus far. The language used isn't used anywhere outside of the class but it is chosen for good reason. The program has unique functionality that helps you to learn how programming works, and has simplifications that wouldn't be used in a language built for efficiency, but make learning to code less confusing. The professor provides copies of each classes notes in the form of code online, which is very useful when doing homework, which also does a good job of teaching information itself. The professor holds daily quizzes, which can be stressful, but they serve as a good check to see if you have been understanding class, and do not count much for your grade. The professor also provides useful study guides and practice tests before the midterms that do a good job of covering the necessary information. One important thing to know about the class is that you shouldn't try to type the code along him in class. You will just end up falling behind him and missing the point. Instead, it is best to just follow along, take notes if necessary, and look at the code he post online if you find something confusing or did not understand the lecture.",
          "Was a very good intro into basic programming structure and style.",
          "Functional Programming will actually be helpful in your future CS career. However, it is not the \"best\" for getting an internship. But it's important to learn it to set groundwork for yourself."

          "I felt this course was helpful and integral in my CS education at NU. I liked that the homework assignments are worth 70% of the grade because those assignments take a ton of time and it felt worth it. I also liked the way the chapter/subject matter was arranged because I felt it built off each other well.",
          "I have never coded before coming to NU and this course was very very challenging. There was not a lot of guidance with specific commands, so I had to look a lot of them up online, which could sometimes be confusing. Live codes during class are hard to keep up with. The hw codes can get difficult and time consuming really fast, so make sure you start really really early!",
          "The homework assignments seemed really convoluted at times but the labs helped me learn a lot",
          "I thought the homework assignments were extremely complicated to what material we were learning. For me, understanding what the homework was asking was a lot more difficult than understanding the CS material that it was supposed to be supporting.",
          "If you've had experience with C++ in the past, this class with likely present some new ideas and some challenging but manageable homework assignments. For those who have not had prior coding experience outside of the prerequisite course, make sure to frequently go to office hours for help, unless you consider yourself to be an extremely quick learner. The pace of the class is relatively fast, so make sure to stay on top of things.",
          "I was very interested in the topic, so I enjoyed the course. However, I thought many aspects of the course could be greatly improved.",
          "The assignments were very enjoyable to code, particularly the last four.",
          "This could be a challenging class overall, especially when Jesse teaches it. However, if you go to the class and understand the materials, you can actually improve your coding skills and thought process.",
          "The lectures weren't as helpful as the discussion classes, but the professor was very accessible as were the TAs. The exams are short but kind of hard.",
          "Lectures were not very applicable/useful to me but the homeworks really helped challenge my understanding (as someone who has previous coding experience). Tests weren't that bad but punished silly mistakes (1 mistake could easily be 5% or more).",
          "I enjoyed the content of the course for the most part. It was sometimes dull but on the whole I'm happy I took it",
          "This class is a great introductory course into learning C++. You learn the nuances of object-oriented programming, classes, memory allocation, and C++-specific utilities such as pointers. The lectures are dry and seem to drag on (I had trouble focusing for the entire 80 minute period), but the lab sessions and homework programs are very stimulating and informative.",
          "I was interested in learning a new language but while taking it I was unhappy with it. The course did not do a good job of teaching me.",
          "The 70% homework project grades. I wish that more EECS classes are like this because programming by art cannot be done once. Knowledge is important, but debugging is a crucial aspect where we learn from our mistakes.",
          "Group assignments are just the worst. Find someone you can trust to work with you on this and use the TA hours--if the person bails on their work this class will be endless torture. The material learned is useful and the exams test in a reasonable way.",
          "Jesse is definitely more helpful in person and if you go to him he is good at explaining things. Definitely go to office hours for this course, it is absolutely crucial.",
          "Tov has strangely formatted lectures which involve live coding, which doesn't seem to appeal to most people I've spoken to. His online grading system for the homework was pretty ok, but sometimes the tests didn't work on code that was functional due to CLion compiling things differently on Macs vs PCs. Make sure your partner has a Mac/Linux if you don't so you can avoid the sadness that comes from having to ask him to reopen an assignment because you swear the code works on your computer.",
          "The HWs were often very confusing and had mistakes on them, without piazza there would consistently be many missing instructions for HW assignments.",
          "Most of the aspects were important to me.",
          "Tov is probably one of the worst *instructors* that I've had here in terms of pure teaching ability in lecture, but he is one of the fairest and most reasonable professors I've had here. His lectures weren't interesting and quite painful to sit through, and I ended up teaching myself the course through Sarah Sood's 211 lecture slides (which you should take instead of this class in the fall or spring). However, the exams were very fair, and they are not meant to trick you in the slightest. They are very straightforward. The PSETS are very hard, but they teach you a lot, definitely go to office hours, because the TAs are super helpful. Tov is a really reasonable person, he just can't teach effectively unfortunately.",
          "Jesse can often move fast in class, but he's definitely willing to slow it down as long as you speak up. This class isn't too difficult especially because 70% of your grade is determined by how well you do on your homework.",
          "Intellectually challenging course. Homeworks can be tough but are meant for you to succeed and learn by doing. Jesse may be a poor/unengaging lecturer but he truly wants his students to succeed and his very helpful answering questions",
          "The best advice I can give: TA hours. They were probably the saving grace for me in this class. I really would have failed this class without them, no joke. Professor Tov is one of the nicest professors, letting you resubmit code if there was an error in the code that made you fail a lot of tests. I still do not like the written style midterms and wish there was a way to be tested by actually making code on a computer. Overall, this class is not difficult if you take advantage of TA hours and do not wait until the last day to write the code.",
          "I got very little out from lecture because of how disorganized it was. That said, content of the course is important to know.",
          "This course was designed for people with a moderate to high understanding of C++. I found the classes to be way too difficult and the assignments were way too difficult as well. My partner and I would spend 20+ hours on the homework and attend office hours and felt that the content was over our heads. The powerpoints were unclear and the code that was embedded in the lectures was unorganized.",
          "Tov knows his stuff, but sometimes struggles with properly teaching it during lecture. Make sure to go to Office Hours so you get a proper understanding of the material.",
          "For those who have taken AP Computer Science A before, this class is basically more or less a repeat of the class in C++ (so + pointers and memory management). Overall, lectures were decent, but most people didn't pay too much attention and could still get by. Find a partner who is willing to split work evenly for homework, as some of the later homework assignments do take a while to complete, albeit they are not extremely difficult. There is a larger than usual focus on testing, that is, a large portion of your grade is focused on whether you have specific tests or not, which can make testing a bit tedious. Jesse is quite nice on extensions and minor mistakes, so don't feel shy to reach out to him outside of class!",
          "Classes in Computer Science are always classes in which most of the learning takes place through homework and studying, which makes Tov's fairly ambiguous, clumsily made homeworks a fairly large problem. Like any EECS class, lectures are tolerable but not amazing, and you learn both annoying and cool techniques, but the badly made homeworks make the difficult transition to C++ and the learning of the more complicated concepts unnecessarily difficult, so it is probably wiser to take 211 with a better teacher if possible.",
          "This class was a bummer. On the first day of class, Dr. Tov scared everyone by jumping directly into Shell. The rest of the quarter did not improve; the professor would blaze through code, and ask, \"Are there any questions?\" Before the stunned students had time to formulate their questions, he would answer, \"good!\" and keep chugging on. Dr. Tov spends much of his time walking us through classes and concepts that are entirely irrelevant to the homework. We had to write a lot of unit tests. This has the good intention of forcing students to think about edge cases; however, it proved to be rather tedious, time-consuming, and unnecessary. It also had the drawback of docking points from assignments even when students passed all the instructor's tests but forgot to write a specific test on their own. EECS 211 should not have been difficult if it was explained properly. However, it ended up being a royal pain.",
          "This class made me want to drop the CS major. It was boring and lots of repeated material. Projects weren't very interesting and the instruction was not engaging and kind of all over the place",
          "It is a great class for C++ lovers. However, I feel the professor was not that great at teaching.",
          "It was an okay class, I enjoyed it and the material was pretty interesting",
          "This course is much better than EECS 111. C++ is a much more fun language to learn. Jesse is smart and nice, but not great at communicating the important concepts clearly. Programs are challenging but doable if you make the effort to meet with TAs. Utilizing Piazza is also important and the instructors and students are very active on it.",
          "Don't take it with jesse. The homeworks are really hard and its frustrating because the last 4 build off each other, so if you screw up the first one you cant do the other ones.",
          "Try, try, try. I learned that in order to gain a mastery of a language, I needed to practice.",
          "The point of the course was to teach you C++, and in my opinion it did it well.",
          "This course feels completely different than 111. I didn't know what was going on for 95% of this course.",
          "This is a fairly straightforward class covering most of the same topics also covered in a typical AP Computer Science course but in C++ instead of Java. Homework was straightforward, but did not facilitate much learning. Exams were quite easy.",
          "The course was very fast-paced, but a great introduction to a real programming language. While we learned the basics of C++, we also learn how to think about building programs and abstracting methods for efficient program design. This is a really self-motivated class, so if you don't go to lecture/write your own homework code, you won't understand the content. It feels hard to catch up once you're behind, so stay on top of the workload, force yourself to focus in class, and complete all the labs and homeworks.",
          "This course is poorly organized. Your grade is largely based (70%) on the homework assignments, which may seem like a good thing. The homeworks are cumulative projects. Each assignment relies upon a perfect score on the last assignment in order to do well.",
          "I think that this course was really interesting and helped stimulate my interest in computer science. that being said, i think the assignments were too difficult for an intro class.",
          "I think this course offers a lot of important programming concepts, not to mention the relevant language of C++, but the teaching style was always going over a few slides then coding for the rest of the 80 minute class, which was fine for me, someone who had 2 years of coding experience in high school, but not as helpful for beginner coders learning these concepts for the first time and trying to understand them while also following along with the code being quickly written on the screen. However you are allowed to do homework in pairs which is nice and encourages people to work together to figure it out which is great.",
          "It's okay.",
          "Professor Tov was a really great instructor and made every effort to clarify anything that is unclear. It could be said the class is lacking a bit of a structural organisation, however it didn't adversey affect learning experience. Also professor was really kind and would be happy to discuss your hw/test, extend a deadline for you if you have a reason, etc.",
          "I couldn't understand them.",
          "Lectures were helpful at all. I recommend skipping lecture and just going to office hours to get the work done. Exams were relatively easy",
          "Get a good partner if you are doing partner work. Mine quit and it caused huge problems for me and the class.",
          "The wordings used in homework instruction was so unclear that most of the time I'm just confused about what to do. Codes that were never introduced were often used in the codes that the instructor has written so most of the time in the lecture I just sat there without knowing what is going on.",
          "It's a nice class for introduction to c++ and Jesse has explained some complex ideas pretty well in lecture. However, I think the homework can be structured to make it less confusing for some part.",
          "Decent class overall. Homework is reasonable since Tov provides starter code that organizes the overall program. Midterm and final were both straight forward but tricky at times. However, class instructions are quite unclear, as he codes really quickly and expects you to be able to follow. Instructions for homework is also sometimes unclear, but having more than a dozen TA sections certainly helps.",
          "Make sure to start the homeworks early! The first few were not particularly challenging, but they become much more difficult towards the end of the course. Take advantage of office hours and Jesse is very accessible. The tests are not particularly difficult or weighted heavily. Get the homeworks done!",
          "Good project assignments, liked how projects worth more than tests",
          "This class essentially teaches you how to code in C++. Overall, the class is not very difficult and grades are based on 7\u02f8 homework assignments (10% each) and 2 midterms (15% each). Tov is a decent teacher although his classes can be boring and hard to understand at times. To be honest, going to class, while recommended, is not really necessary. All in all, it is a standard EECS 200 level class.",
          "It was an okay class. A lot of material and challenged me fairly well, but Tov's teaching style was a little dry",
          "The class was fairly simple at the beginning, but had a marked jump in difficulty halfway through and the instruction did not always match the homeworks",
          "This course was great at challenging me intellectually, as well as teaching me, because I went from nearly zero programming experience to a substantial amount in this class. I often had struggles doing the homework, but the tests were decently easy.",
          "Jesse is a smart and nice guy, but lectures tended to be overwhelming and hard to understand",
          "Learnt a lot as a non-CS major and C++ is a really useful programming language. The class was challenging and some homeworks required quite a lot of work but it was worth it.",
          "I had to take this for CS major, but it got very hard in the middle. The homeworks are much harder than the exams.",
          "The lectures for this course felt unnecessarily complicated and were not engaging. Slides were brief and often led into live coding for the second half of the class, which went by so quickly that it wasn't actually informative. Professor was nice, but not a good lecturer- take this class with another if available. Homeworks were time-consuming and often required assignment clarifications on Piazza / frantic OH visits on the days that they were due.",
          "Jesse's lectures are really impossible to follow along with. I don't really understand how so many people get C++ but in general, a really useful class that teaches you a crucial CS skill.",
          "Yes, it was challenging",
          "Lots of emphasis on homework, not too much on exams. Lecture not too helpful, mostly understand material when doing the HW problem sets.",
          "I didn't love this course because it took a ton of time, and I felt that going to lecture was pointless, which I don't think is the feeling I should get i a class is really stimulating. However, looking back on the stuff we learned in the beginning, I feel like I have learned a lot in this class that will be extremely helping in my Computer Science major.",
          "The homework is pretty challenging and time consuming.",
          "The pace is fast but Prof. Tov is very accessible and helpful.",
          "Tests were straightforward, but challenging. HW was extremely time consuming.",
          "I would high recommend against taking this class wth Tov. He explains basic ideas in a confusing, convoluted way and incorporates too much jargon. Because the lectures are so hard to follow, the homework are really tough, and take up a ton of time. Also, the grading of the homework is really rough because the instructions are very vague.",
          "Start your homeworks early, go to office hours early in the week",
          "I really enjoyed this course. Jesse was a fantastic lecturer, and I enjoyed the homework assignments.",
          "I wish that the topics were covered more in depth. In my opinion, it felt like the course was taught more as a review for people who already knew the material as opposed to teaching the new material, and as such the course didn't properly explain certain things and I spent a lot of time on online websites learning new concepts.",
          "Jesse is amazing and super smart -- he really cares about his students. Although his lectures are not super organized and go way too deep into the content, he's really good at helping us learn through homework.",
          "A super helpful course. Jesse was one of the most understanding professors I've had. He helped beyond class, he gave me tips on finding internships and lab work. He was super understanding when we needed extra help.",
          "Learning how to code, different structures used in coding.",
          "The course challenges you with the projects that it's giving.",
          "You'll learn C++. I thought it would be worse, but it was actually not that bad. Start the homework early.",
          "You learn the basics of programming in C++. The homework are difficult and require a lot of time in office hours but the tests are straight forward and if you know the basics you will do fine.",
          "I wasn't able to learn well with this professor. I couldn't follow the lectures at all. The HW and labs were more instructional, and I was only able to do them because of previous programming experience. The HW takes a while to debug but overall an OK course. Try to take with a different professor. Midterm and final were reasonable and not too much of your grade."

Professor Sood does a good job of breaking down the content in slides and then applying it in the homework programs, which makes learning the content fairly straightforward as long as you put in the time. Lectures are definitely difficult to stay engaged in, but that's just the nature of CS lectures.",
          "This course is definitely more challenging than EECS 111, but I wouldn't say it's too hard. Sara is great, as usual. Some of the assignments were a bit frustrating but going to office hours definitely helped.",
          "This course is a great course to learn computer programming and teaches many relevant skills",
          "difficult",
          "This class was hard. I have never been a huge fan of programming, but even though this class was hard I think I learned a lot. I don't think my grade will end up being great in this class, but the amount that I learned about programming and the confidence that I gained from the many assignments is great!",
          "Foundational",
          "Take this course from Sara if you can. She explains concepts extremely well and makes class enjoyable and interesting.",

          "This was a great course for learning C++, Sara does an absolutely amazing job at lectures keeping things interesting and engaging! Homeworks can take some time but are great for applying what we've learned in class.",
          "Sara is the best but the exams are definitely hard. Study far in advance if possible!",
          "The class itself is fine, it's hard to pay attention when things aren't directly correlated with the homework that we're currently working on. I would appreciate if the class was taught towards the homework more.",
          "Sara is a really good professor and as long as you get help when you need it, the class is manageable. Use the office hours and the piazza page, they are very helpful.",
          "I took 111 with Sara as well and she is an amazing lecturer and has a really good class structure that really helps you learn the material. In addition to TA's and office hours, all the resources necessary to do well in this class are there for you.",
          "This class was well taught and well structured. Highly recommend.",
          "The class was great! Sara will be one of the greatest professors you'll have when taking a cs class.",
          "I'm so glad I got to take 211 with Sara. She's probably one of the best professors you will have at Northwestern: she's fun, engaging, and knows what she's talking about. If you take 211, take it with Sara Sood!",
          "This class is clearly intended for CS majors, and given that I am an IE major with no coding experience, I did very poorly. I couldn't even spend time with TAs to better understand concepts because all my time was spent with them trying to do the homework assignments.",
          "Overall very good, I like the sequence we followed",

          "Sara is very helpful and caring of her students. However, don't expect it to be as easy as 111. I would finish assignments in an hour, but then spend another three in office hours and debugging. Utilize the resources and pay attention in class if you haven't seen this material before.",
          "Great class! I learned a lot and Professor Sood is so amazing. I haven't met such a kind EECS professor before. She is really considerate and helpful and I can tell she wants students to learn regardless of what abilities they have coming into the class",
          "Go to office hours and attend all classes! It's not required, but reading the chapters on the book was really helpful especially after you come out of class and still confused on what is happening (which is a lot of times). Find a study buddy so you guys can popcorn questions while studying together! Was really helpful reviewing for the exam.",
          "I enjoyed this course! Sara is the best professor at NU and she makes computer science interesting. The homework can be difficult and the first exam was harder than I expected, but overall there are so many great resources like Piazza and Sara so you can always get help.",

          "Class starts of slow, but picks up pretty quick. Office hours always available tho to help",
          "This course was great. I felt that I was able to follow without much issue following EECS 111. Sara is a fantastic instructor and is very helpful when answering questions outside of class.",
          "I found it hard to focus on the lecture in class. However, the book and the peer mentor office hours were wonderful. I went every week to see Yehya, and every week he helped me learn the theory behind the assignments and I came out of the office hours with more knowledge than when I came in. Without these hours I would not have succeeded in the class.",

          "Sara was a great teacher! Only take 211 with her",
          "Liked this course more than EECS 111. The hw assignments are fun to do; i would suggest to start doing them early. TAKE THIS COURSE WITH PROF. SARA. It's upsetting that there's no curve in this class, but it really helps you understand whether you like coding or not.",
          "This course got a little fast-paced near the end of the quarter. However, the homework programs did not really test any of the topics we learned later on, like templates, STL, streams, overloading. Also, the homework programs had a lot of provided code already filled in, which was helpful for saving time, but I wish I could practice building a program on my own for the homework. Overall, though, I learned a lot in this course, and Sara was a great professor.",
          "This class was really important in giving me a better understanding of back-end programming.",
          "The lectures are rather pointless. You need hands on learning for EECS and that just doesn't come from large lectures.",
          "HARD!! But Sarah is amazing and it is a good course",
          "Sara is the best!! This class was a step up from EECS 111. It was more focused on the details of C++. Assignments probably took me 3 or 4 hours.",
          "This class is taught really well and I there are examples for every concept learned. Sara did a great job of teaching the material.",
          "this is a challenging but really great course. I loved the assignments because they took time but were really satisfying when finished. I also am fluent in C++ now ands really understand it",
          "It was a pretty good class. Sara's great as usual and homework isnt as bad as 111. That being said there is a lot more content than 111 so don't fall behind.",
          "Sara is AMAZING she's a great teacher and definitely challenges you but makes it manageable. The assignments are usually pretty fine (like you have to sit down and focus but they're not impossible to do) but if you get stuck you can spend hours and hours trying to debug your code",
          "It's a C++ class. If you know C++ or have done a lot of programming before, then it will be very easy. Otherwise, prepare to work.",
          "Sara is the reason I took on a CS minor. She is an incredible teacher. I took her 111 in the winter and loved her teaching style. Also, she's very patient when answering questions (which she asks for often) and never makes anybody feel bad for asking repetitive questions - she'll find another way to answer it instead. The course was easy to me, not too conceptually challenging, but very fascinating for someone whose only CS background was 111. C++ is a mess of a language but it was fun to learn and super useful. Exams aren't easy, but they're straightforward. Assignments and exam expectations are all very clearly outlined and easy to understand.",
          "The course was a good way to learn C++ programming and builds upon the previous course well",
          "I felt like this course well prepared me to learn how to learn other languages, which is incredibly useful skill.",
          "Sara is just awesome. Doesn't give more work than is necessary, and in class she is great at explaining things clearly and answering questions. Also just an awesome person to get to know. Absolutely take this with Sara if you can.",
          "Sara is a fantastic professor; super helpful during office hours and willing to provide guidance on anything, from assignments to course materials to future interests/paths in computer science. This class definitely goes deeper into computer science as a discipline and field beyond programming, and I learned a lot about what computer science truly is and means at a fundamental level. This class can be a challenge at times but a worthy one without a doubt.",
          "I thought 211 was just the right level of difficulty. I had to try hard to do well and finish homework assignments, but it was rewarding.",
          "Having never done object oriented programming before and very little programming in general, I found this class to be challenging but rewarding. Definitely doable without any coding experience other than 111, but I really had to be on my stuff to keep up. Everything is given to you in order to do well, but you really have to take advantage of all of it. Sara is great too; I've only had her as a EECS lecturer so I don't have much to compare to, but she makes a huge lecture hall feel so much smaller.",
          "I loved this course! It was a bit difficult to understand, but as long as I reviewed the material right after class and on weekends, I was able to finish the homework early every week! Sara is also extremely approachable with even the seemingly dumb questions I had! This class was so much fun! I looked forward to it every other weekday!",
          "Very interesting to learn about computer science; I think I will switch my major to it.",
          "This class is the next step up after 111. While it is harder than 111, it is definitely manageable and very worthwhile. C++ is a really useful language, and the class teaches you some good general programming techniques and practices. Exams and weekly assignments are similar to what was done in 111; I took the two courses back to back with Sara and felt like it was a very logical jump from one to the other. If you've programmed in Java before, C++ will come naturally to you, especially at the beginning, though after a certain point the similarities go out the window. Also, TAKE THIS CLASS WITH SARA! SHE IS A WONDERFUL HUMAN BEING AND AN AWESOME TEACHER! Overall, would recommend, especially if you enjoyed 111.",
          "We covered a lot of computer science essentials like linked lists and pointers.",
          "EECS 211 with Sara was an excellent class. She made the content very clear in lectures, her office hours were incredibly helpful, and the homeworks were straightforward!",
          "Learning a subject useful in the real computer science world for the first time, which was nice. Assignments and class times were enjoyable to complete and attend.",
          "It was a pretty standard course with 2 midterms and a lab every week, but definitely a step up from 111 in terms of difficulty.",
          "Great class. Learn a lot of important material that prepares you very well for later courses.",
          "This is a great course. It is challenging, but it's fair and extremely interesting. Sara is absolutely incredible.",
          "This class was a lot harder than EECS111 the programs were tough and it was hard to get caught up once you fell behind. Sarah does a really good job at explaining, just something you really need to practice",
          "Sara is by far the best professor I have had at Northwestern. She explains concepts very clearly and highlights why things are important for us to learn. It is clear that she cares about her students because she is always happy to answer questions in class and is welcoming at her many office hours. Visit her even if it's just to chat! That said, 211 could be better designed as a course. The weekly programming assignments are not quite enough to get practice with concepts from class, especially those taught at the end of the quarter. As with 111, the code structure has been designed for you, and you are really just implementing small pieces. It would be nice to see projects that allow us greater creativity.",
          "The class size is very large, but Professor Sood did a great job managing class size and teaching all necessary material for exams.",
          "Tough class. Make sure you go to class and office hours. It's hard to come back.",
          "Take 211 with Sara Sood. She is a great lecturer b\u02fc she is organized and has clear examples. Not a CS major, so this class is the reason why I learned how to code at NU.",
          "Very easy if you pay attention in class, ask questions if you're confused, and do the review sheets before the midterm. This quarter there were 8 coding assignments (weekly), 2 midterms, and an extra credit assignment that make up your whole grade. Also, Sara's office hours are suuuuper helpful! (Sara is just an amazing professor in general also)",
          "It was a challenging course for me but I learnt a lot",
          "Solid class but the tests can be a bit unfair, missing one multiple choice question can drop your grade by a letter",
          "Sara is one of the best teachers at Northwestern. Her examples are very good and the course is very fair.",
          "Good",
          "You learn to code. Nuff said.",
          "You do learn the language, but it's hard to concentrate in the big lectures.",
          "I liked how the assignments gradually built upon each other. They were the best way to test if I was keeping up with the lecture material.",
          "The class explained both practical and abstract topics related to the subject very well.",
          "This is a really helpful class to learn the basics of CS and the homework assignments can be difficult but they are very helpful for learning to concepts. The tests can also be tricky bet they are very fair.",
          "Overall a good class. Sara is hands down the best EECS professor so take all the classes that you can with her. Sometimes this class could be conceptually difficult since you have to understand how programs are executed and stored in memory rather than simply writing programs without considering how the computer interprets everything. The exams aren't bad either, and it's not too hard to get a good grade in this class if you enjoy computer science and put in the work.",
          "This class is great, but it's definitely difficult if you're not comfortable programming in C++ when you come in. It's super rewarding, and I strongly suggest it if you have any interest in programming.",
          "It allowed me to know another language.",
          "EECS 211 is great with Sara. Her presentations and teaching are very helpful for learning and also the multiple in-class examples really help you understand. The programming assignments let you put what you know to practice and thus those were also really helpful. I'm not sure Unix is necessary though so I would take that out of the curriculum, but besides that it was a very helpful and insightful class.",
          "211 was great! Sara is an excellent professor and I would highly recommend taking it with her. The exams and difficult but the programs are manageable.",
          "Definitely a harder course than 111, but well organized and well taught. Lots of resources for help!",
          "Sara is a great teacher, and the assignments given really help you understand the course material.",
          "sara was great as always, much faster than 111 but go to office hours",
          "I really liked this course! Sara is great and its easy to come into after EECS 111 with her. Such a good class & lots of support outside of class.",
          "Sara is great. Big classes are hard to pay attention",
          "Sara is a great teacher and this class is great. The homeworks aren't that hard even if you're not that experienced with programming and the peer mentors are very helpful.",
          "Very happy with the course, Sood's a wonderful professor and well suited to teaching the introductory CS courses and encouraging commitment + confidence in the subject.",
          "learned a lot and challenged while succeeding",
          "The tests are kind of difficult just because writing code on a piece of paper without a computer is difficult.",
          "Take this with Sara! She's a fantastic lecturer.",
          "Great course. Taught a ton of fundamentals that are necessary for computer science. It's taught in a way that makes the material seems really accessible.",
          "Sara is a very good professor and she always teaches with examples of code which are helpful for understanding the concepts. This course (especially the homeworks) is not hard at all if you have some background coding",
          "Course is interesting and teaches you important essentials of C++ programming. Homeworks don't take more than 2 hours per week on average.",
          "A refreshing, super-applicable class after Racket (111). Sara is incredible, as I'm sure you've heard time and time again. It's easy to not want to go to class after the first midterm, especially if you've had CS experience and do well (since it's for/while loops, basics, etc), but DON'T STOP GOING TO CLASS. Homeworks get harder as the quarter progresses: start them early, because last-minute coding on a Friday night is very stressful, and debugging always takes longer than you think.",
          "Easy if you've done C++ or really any OOP before. Pointers are the only thing that were new to my former-programmer friends. Those who hadn't done any programming outside of 111 seemed to have a difficult time.",
          "Over ehh, 111 was better taught and while C++ is more useful it loses clarity when you're not apply the things you learn directly.",

          "This was one of the hardest CS classes I have taken at Northwestern. I'm very glad I took with Hartline as I learned a lot. The class has gotten easier than it was in the past but the weekly homeworks and peer reviews can be brutal. Leave some space open in your schedule and find a good partner before taking this class.",

          "There are a lot of EECS courses I have felt were unnecessarily hard and time consuming. This is NOT one of those courses. Hartline's version is hard as hell, but you will learn so much taking it that it is 100% worth taking. I genuinely feel more intelligent having taken this class and highly recommend it to anyone willing to put in the work.",
          "Hard, hard class. Jason fixed a lot of the issues now, so it's hard because algorithms are hard, and not hard because they're trying to screw us. With that said, expect to spend a lot of time on this class, because it's really difficult to do well. You will learn a lot, though, and will come out a much better computer scientist.",
          "The course was very well organized and taught exceptionally.",
          "This course is a lot of fun. You learn interesting techniques and solve many fun problems. Hartline is also a wonderful instructor. I was not a huge fan of the peer grading, though I do recognize that it probably did help people who had trouble evaluating proofs.",
          "I think we also need some courses covering some basic aspects.",

          "Jason has gotten a lot nicer this year. The class is also significantly easier than it was in past years. It's still challenging, but not unreasonably so. You should absolutely take this instead of 335: it's much more useful.",

Professor Hartline's guides to the course materials are invaluable, and they really helped my understanding.",

          "Algorithms is a very important concept to learn, but I felt that I was not able to get the most out of the class. Lectures were hard to follow and understand, which resulted in a high dependence on hw assignments to learn the material. But because it was so hard to follow during class, most of the material was learned in TA office hours. We spent the first 5 weeks on greedy algorithms and breezed through the other material. The course felt badly organized, as we even spent a lecture going over material that was covered the previous week because one student voiced that they did not understand it. It felt like a waste of time to go to class, and while the prof is a very nice. he was not very good at explaining the material. The hw assignments were nice because there was a programming aspect to it, which gave the course more concrete problems to solve. The two midterms were short answer problems on greedy algos and dynamic programming, and they were very difficult. The final was a complete change in structure, as we were not tested on proofs but of algorithms such as finding the cost of minimum spanning trees. It was much easier and we knew what to expect.",
          "This offering of algorithms was really reasonable -- there was plenty of resources to understand the material like discussion section, office hours, and a good textbook, good structure in weekly homework assignments, and good communication to help us to be prepared and succeed.",
          "",
          "",
          "The homework accounted for 44% of the grade at the end, which meant that you could do reasonably well by doing consistent good work, despite messing up on a few questions during midterms.",
          "",
          "",
          "For a grad student, the work load was reasonable. I think the pacing was adjusted for the class, but lots of time was spent on greedy algorithms, and less time for other topics.",
          "Algorithms was actually pretty fun. Not too hard with very exciting problems. Konstantin really cares about his students and wants you to learn. One of the nicest professors ever.",
          "Algos with Makarychev was definitely not as hard as this class if often portrayed to be. I think Makarychev did a good job of making the class more accessible to many, but in the mean time it seems like we lost a lot of material from the syllabus. Only the second midterm was hard- the first midterm and final were pretty manageable. No need to be afraid of this class with Konstantin.",
          "This was a strange run of algorithms. We only had 6 assignments, 5 of them were on greedy algos, and none of it was excruciatingly hard. The midterms were challenging but fine, and the final was short answer/T\u02ff. The communication from the instructor was incredibly frustrating, often questions about important logistics would be asked multiple times on piazza and would go entirely unanswered. All announcements in class were often vague as well, and that made things really confusing. Lectures were also hard to follow.",
          "Decent course. Professor was somewhat confusing lecturer, but was accessible to students and seems eager to improve.",
          "Go to office hours for help on weekly problem sets! There were three exams this quarter, the last multiple choice. Exams were pretty hard in general.",
          "This class is great for anyone looking to get into technical interviews or anyone interested in famous algorithms like the Knapsack problem. I feel like this class has something that everyone will find interesting.",
          "Professor is kind and knowledgeable but is disorganized overall.",
          "This was a fun course that taught me problem solving methodologies.",
          "It's a bit rushed and disjointed because the professor is still trying to figure out the best curriculum. Lectures can be dry, the problem sets get harder throughout the course, and the midterms are super hard but the professor really wants the students to learn, so the curve is generous and the final is super easy.",
          "TAKE THIS COURSE WITH KONSTATIN. He has made this course very doable in comparison to other professors here, adding also a coding component instead of just raw theory which helps to make the transition.",
          "Challenging course with homeworks, 2 midterms, and a final. Homework is doable, but the exams are rather difficult.",
          "The course was not paced very well. It's a shame; this algorithms class could be so much better.",
          "Lenient grading, good test cases provided to run your program against.",
          "The explanation to the materials is not well presented making it quite hard to understand. I normally can find some other explanations on internet which are way simpler and more clear. I am repeatedly shocked by how such a simple stuff can be explained so confusing. The TA never gave full solution just drawing some basic idea on blackboard. While, the grading criteria seems require very detailed solution and can vary much between different graders.",
          "Professor Makarychev is the man. You can tell he genuinely wants you to learn, and given the complexity of the material, he tends to present it in as understandable a way as possible. The content itself is interesting, but there is a bit too much of a focus on greedy algorithms. Dynamic programming was interesting, but it wasn't covered for very long... All in all, great course.",
          "I'm unfortunately really disappointed with this class. For context, I had dropped this course the quarter prior, and this time around some positive changes were put in place (but unfortunately not enough were made). My main struggle with the class was the lack of helpful resources for students. Slides were severly underdetailed, making it very hard to study for exams. Professor Makarychev moved at a very fast pace, and sometimes verbally explained algorithms without diagrams or slides. If you got lost early on in the lecture, there was little chance you\u027d be able to catch up without asking lots of questions. As well, there were practically no formal introductions to the techniques of how to prove algorithms, which forced students to have to deduce strategies or terminology either from class examples or online resources. I know from fellow students that professors who taught this course in the past used to have handouts explaining strategies to develop proofs; there was no such resource in this course, but we were expected to use these strategies nonetheless. Getting feedback was incredibly slow, as homeworks\u02fexams took on average more than a month to get back. Tests were incredibly difficult, one of which only had a single question, and I know of many students who were caught off guard by the exams. Professor Makarychev does care about his students, as shown by his willingness to answer questions and provide opportunities to earn back credit, but I really hope he takes the time to revise the course in a way that focuses less on specific examples of algorithms and more on actually learning how to design and prove them.",
          "I didn't learn about as many topics as I would have liked. The teacher went really slow, so I only really got to spend lots of time on greedy and DP algorithms. Homework was easy; exams were much harder.",
          "Algorithms are a very fascinating subject, but only if they explained well. The professor is a nice guy and means well, but the structure and organization of the class are abysmal. Lectures are usually not worth going to. It seems often that the professor is not quite \"in touch\" with the student perspective and doesn't realize what is and isn't challenging to students. Reading the book generally does a better job",
          "This class was hard. Weekly assignment, 2 extremely difficult midterms and a pretty easy final. It was challenging throughout, every single assignment challenged me and it took the full week to come up with solutions. However, it's extremely satisfying when it works out and you find one because you feel like you are truly learning, and learning very prominent information for your future (if computer science).",
          "We spent like 6 weeks learning about greedy algorithms and then 2 weeks for DP and another 2 of misc lectures. Going to lecture wasn't that useful since it was quite slow and repetitive but the exams are pretty easy and Konstantin is a very smart guy so I\u027d recommend you take Algos with him.",
          "THIS CLASS IS HARD. Granted, I don't like theory and that has a lot to do with my view. This is the only theory class I've taken here so I don't have anything to compare it to but the material is often confusing and difficult to apply to new questions/situations. The professor is good though, he really wants his students to understand and is really nice when you ask him questions about anything.",
          "I have mixed feelings for algorithms with Konstantin. We had 6 homeworks, 5 of which were on greedy algorithms, which is essentially the first half of the course. Alright, fine. The first two midterms were very challenging, and the second focused on dynamic programming, which we sort of rushed through and no one understood. However, the final is more objective\u2feasy, and the grading\u02fassignments could have been worse. Definitely not as nightmarishly hard as what previous quarters of this class have been. Still, one could always hope to get more out of a core class for all CS majors.",
          "Seemed to be a hard quarter on the professor. Homework covered only greedy and dynamic programming since lectures kept on being pushed back due to unclear communication and teaching. I don't think Markarychev is a bad professor (he's great in office hours), but students don't like his lecture style and as a result resort to self-learning and self-teaching. Take this class if you want a relatively easy grade, but take it with Hartline if you want to learn more.",
          "Take this class w/ Makarychev. This class was not nearly as bad as I expected. The assignments aren't super easy, but by no means awful. Basically, this class is about practicing designing algorithms (and proving that they're correct), not about facts. It's getting better at thinking in this way. I hated 212, and this class wasn't nearly as painful.",
          "Take this class with Makarychev, he really cares about the students doing well, and the class is very manageable (seems like less work than with the other professors).",
          "This seems like an important class to take but we didn't cover that many topics so I didn't learn as much as I expected to.",
          "Taking this class Makarychev is probably easier than with Hartline, but I also feel like we didn't learn that much, which is unfortunate for a college-level computer science algorithms class. We spent a lot of time on greedy algorithms and not much else. Kostya is also quite a dry and boring lecturer, and his smooth Russian accent put me to sleep more times than I want to admit. Madhav, our graduate TA, was awesome though! I ended up mostly learning by going to his weekly discussion sections instead of going to lecture itself.",
          "We didn't cover nearly enough relative to what we should've learned in this class",
          "I really enjoyed the course. Some people were saying that Prof. Makarychev's accent is a bit unclear however I found it just fine.",
          "Midterms were tough, especially the second one (open notes, creative problem solving), but the final was straight forward if you study for it (closed notes, lecture material based questions)."

Many things were self learnt or learnt through looking at other's people codes because there was no guidance on these labs. Whenever the labs were assigned, it was a given that we would have to figure out everything ourselves, including the concept, language, etc. It was hard to apply things we've learned in class when we're so busy trying to get used to the coding language.",

Its understandable because it is supposed to be the necessary basics of Computer Systems but still, very hard to keep up with the lectures. If you push off reading/studying, your FINAL WEEKS WILL BE TORTUROUS because you will have the final to study for, the hardest lab that is known to take 15-50 hours to complete, and a homework assignment. Professor Bischoff is very intelligent, but is not very good at conveying his knowledge to people that don't know/understand the material, which is usually everyone because they haven't taken the class yet.",

He isn't a great lecturer, it's not really worth going to class. The Malloc lab timing was absolutely, 100% ridiculous. Why would put the hardest lab during finals week? It just is unfair, completely sadistic and utterly deflating. He actively changed the scheduled labs so that we would have the malloc lab last. I am honestly shocked. Also having it due the day after our final? Have a heart.",
          "I think that a lot of ctecs might mention that they didn't go to lectures because they found alternative learning options more effective, in Zach's defense, he did make an effort to teach the concepts and clearly understood them well, but it's very hard to teach better than videotaped lectures of the same content, especially because they give the rewinding option. Also, the way this course is graded, it is much more effective towards assignments/tests to read the textbook exclusively (e.g. content not clear from the slides being tested).",
          "Going to class was pointless because the professor wasn't a great lecturer. Labs take a long time, homework takes a good amount of time too unless you really understand the material, and the midterm placed a lot of weight on material that was only briefly covered. Get a good partner for homework/labs to suffer through this class with.",

A flipped classroom is a great idea if you're going to execute it correctly-- by giving us lectures to watch outside of class and giving us class time to actually work on things. Instead, we were expected to read a very dense textbook and listen to Dinda ramble for a while-- it's hard to know what you don't understand when just reading the textbook. I love that we were just told directly to go to the CMU website and use their slides instead of Dinda actually lecturing. At least he salvaged it with tons of extra credit and relatively easy exams, but if I'm paying four grand for a course, I\u027d like to be taught, and not just referred to another university's slides. Complete waste of my time and caused so much unnecessary stress.",

I dropped last quarter to take it this quarter, doesn't seem there is a good quarter to take it since Bishoff also couldn't teach very well.

Malloc lab is definitely very time consuming, but you actually learn a lot from them and they are pretty interesting in retrospect. There are 4 homework's and 4 labs, plus a midterm and a final. Nikos and Vincent are really good lecturers.",

While the labs are fun and interesting, they are also incredibly difficult, prompting people to use online resources. The topics learned in lecture are sometimes irrelevant to the hws and don't show up on exams.

It is also cumulative as the course goes on, so if you do not understand a concept it is important to try to figure it out before the next class. There are TA office hours every day i believe, so it shouldn't be too hard to find the help you need.",

Go to class, take notes, make sure you deeply understand all the material. Also, the last lab (malloc) is the single hardest assignment I've faced yet in college. My partner and I started a week and a half early, spent over 40 hours on it, and still turned it in half done. This is a necessary class, but be prepared for it.",
          "While the content of this course was not unreasonably difficult, the labs were definitely the hardest part of the class. The homeworks reflected the content of the course more so than the labs did and were a better indicator of the content of exams. The midterm was extremely difficult but the professors made it up by making the final easier. Definitely get an early start on the labs and homeworks and take advantage of office hours!",
          "This class was very difficult and hard to keep pace with. The lectures were very dry and the assignments are difficult.",
          "I think there is a lot of important material covered in this course and I learned a lot about the bridge between hardware and software and how to use this information to be a better programmer. However, this course has TOO much material squished into one quarter. I think the course needs to be split between two quarters so students really understand the material and have more time for it to click. The labs are also too difficult. Also, this course is just a copy of the CMU course which is frustrating. It is hard to want to attend lecture when you can just watch the equivalent original CMU lectures. It's also hard to respect the teachers and assignments when they just copy from CMU. It also makes people more likely to cheat on the assignments.",
          "The class was quite difficult at times, but is necessary in preparation for classes to come.",
          "Start the labs early and do weekly readings.",
          "I'm not sure how useful this class will be to most people, but it's very hard and not very well taught. Things that come up in class don't always appear in the homework, but do show up on the midterm (haven't taken the final yet, it's gonna be cheeks). Reading the book before class might help if the book weren't made by the same people we steal the curriculum from. The slides and the book are confusing. @profs make sure your TAs know what they're doing so they don't confuse other students",
          "I am so disappointed in this class. Peer mentor office hours were only offered Monday - Friday from 11-12 and another hour on Friday. I had to deliberately skip my other classes in order to make office hours because the homework and labs were tough. There should have been more peer mentor office hours offered maybe in the evenings.",
          "This class is very difficult. I highly recommend reading the book before each lecture if you want to do well. Labs and homework are both challenging, and it is very important that you go to office hours when you have questions.",
          "Obviously a very very difficult class, but the concepts are interesting enough to make the homeworks bearable.",
          "For me, lecture for this course was brutally boring. I thought that the labs and content were actually pretty interesting, but it was hard for me to see how things in lecture were relevant until after I had completed the lab for that section.",

They both understand the field deeply, doing a great job of pointing out overarching themes and interesting historical context. Their lecture slides were very helpful and carried me through the class. Nikos' voice is also musical and pleasant to listen to; it helps me not fall asleep in class. Heh.",

The labs easily take 25+ hours a week and alot of times, we had homework assignments on top of that so it didn't make it any easier.

Not only that, the instructors literally get the slides from Carnegie-Mellon and proceed to quickly read off of them while explaining very little or assuming we already know what the heck any of this even means. There was no proper explanation of any concept, including the labs, which were downright impossible to complete. TA's had very minimal office hours (1 hour per day, during which I wasn't available) and Nikos made it very difficult to ask questions in class, due to his condescending attitude and tone. I struggled immensely in this course, and our averages were awful. I don't know why this course hasn't been redone yet. It's terribly designed and leaves me feeling that I'm not even qualified to do any work relating to assembly, caches, etc. I wish the instructors cared about our success, but from what I've observed, they really don't.",
          "This class is hard. The amount of information you're required to learn could easily be spread into 2 quarters. Probably half of my class dropped after the midterm. If you're taking this class, expect to work hard. By far the hardest CS core class.",

I think the most important thing to note about the class is that it mimicks the original class from CMU. The slides are a derivative from CMU as well as the tests, homeworks, and labs. As a result, there was plenty of online content to learn from if in-class lectures were not enough. In fact, CMU's own online video-taped lectures was one of the most important resources in this class and worth looking at. There are only 2 classes a week and each 1hr20mins. Thus, most of the learning responsibility is definitely on the student's side. The two lectures are NOT enough to cover all the material and it is extremely important to read ahead and learn. In my opinion, if it were not for the online content for 213, my learning experience would have been very different and I perhaps would have had negative opinions about this class.",
          "It's the hardest EECS class I've ever taken, but it's some pretty interesting stuff. It gets less appealing as it goes on, though.",
          "Avoid this class at all costs!

Be sure to start assignments early and go to office hours whenever you can.",
          "This course is a very material-heavy approach to system-level CS. It gives you a good knowledge of x86 assembly language and of low-level operations that you don't necessarily think about programming with a higher-level language. There is also a good amount of information and a lab involving low-level security exploits, which was very interesting.",
          "it was hard",
          "This class is not as bad as people may make it seem. Nikos and Vincent are great professors and as long as you go to class, you'll do fine. The readings go hand in hand with the lectures so if you cant make a lecture or you want to get ahead, the book is right there. Homeworks aren't bad and help you learn but labs are sometimes really long and not very productive",

This class is definitely a weed-out class and was taken from Carnegie Mellon, where it is their weed-out class as well. This class is actually so infamous that I mentioned it to an older relative who is in tech and had never gone to college and he knew of the class and how hard it was just through word of mouth. Moving forward to how this section was specifically taught, I did not like the instruction. The content covered in the class is pretty difficult and there is a lot covered. The lectures were not very clear and were too monotone and lifeless so as to make it hard to focus. Nicos wasn't terrible at explaining things but not great either. As a professor, he does not seem to care that much about his students, helping them, and doesn't really respond to student's concerns about the class in general. I generally would not recommend him as a professor for this reason. Outside of class, it didn't feel like we really had many resources for help. There were a handful of TAs that were amazing and that I owe my grade to but most of the other TAs didn't really know the content well and/or didn't really try that hard to help students. The classwork consists of homework and labs that switch off every other week. The homework is kind of hard but can be accomplished if you really understand the material and/or go to office hours; the labs, not so much. The labs are incredibly hard and the only way I got through them was by putting an incredible amount of time into them and by working together with everyone I know and help from TAs when I could; even then, I am not sure how I finished. The exams are usually pretty brutal; the average on the first exam before an unplanned curve was applied was in the 40s. The second exam wasn't as bad but was only easier in response to how poorly everyone did on the first one. Overall, this class is pretty brutal and does not have any mercy. I would not recommend taking it if you don't have to.",

Professor office hours really helped me get a handle on the material, so don't forget to make use of them. That being said, this course is HARD. Homework can take a lot of time if you don't understand it and labs can take 15+ hours each. Take notes during lectures, do the reading (The textbook is really good and easy to understand), go to office hours, and start labs and homeworks as soon as they're assigned. Really cool course, a LOT of work.",

Definitely find a partner you can work with and this class will be much less difficult.

          "The class is difficult, attending lectures and office hours will help you out a lot. There are no curves, so don't come in expecting one just because the course is difficult. Despite all of that, it was still very fun, and a learned a whole of stuff during the course.",
          "This course is very difficult and is probably the most difficult of the core requirements for CS. Be prepared to put in a lot of time on the 4 lab assignments and spend a good amount of time outside of lecture learning the material. There is no curve in this class, but they adjust the grade ranges down. If you do a good job on the homeworks and labs, but struggle on the tests (like I did) you should be able to get a B+\u02fa-."

In fact, CMU's own online video-taped lectures was one of the most important resources in this class and worth looking at. There are only 2 classes a week and each 1hr20mins. Thus, most of the learning responsibility is definitely on the student's side. The two lectures are NOT enough to cover all the material and it is extremely important to read ahead and learn. In my opinion, if it were not for the online content for 213, my learning experience would have been very different and I perhaps would have had negative opinions about this class.",
          "Weed out course for cs majors. It's tough and a lot of time and might not seem worth it, but you learn a lot.",
          "While the content of this course was not unreasonably difficult, the labs were definitely the hardest part of the class. The homeworks reflected the content of the course more so than the labs did and were a better indicator of the content of exams. The midterm was extremely difficult but the professors made it up by making the final easier. Definitely get an early start on the labs and homeworks and take advantage of office hours!",
          "This course is very difficult and is probably the most difficult of the core requirements for CS. Be prepared to put in a lot of time on the 4 lab assignments and spend a good amount of time outside of lecture learning the material. There is no curve in this class, but they adjust the grade ranges down. If you do a good job on the homeworks and labs, but struggle on the tests (like I did) you should be able to get a B+\u02fa-.",
          "The class was quite difficult at times, but is necessary in preparation for classes to come.",
          "The professors are pretty bad at making tests that are feasible to finish in the allotted time period. Additionally, the course material itself is just slides that are almost verbatim content from the book.",
          "I think there is a lot of important material covered in this course and I learned a lot about the bridge between hardware and software and how to use this information to be a better programmer. However, this course has TOO much material squished into one quarter. I think the course needs to be split between two quarters so students really understand the material and have more time for it to click. The labs are also too difficult. Also, this course is just a copy of the CMU course which is frustrating. It is hard to want to attend lecture when you can just watch the equivalent original CMU lectures. It's also hard to respect the teachers and assignments when they just copy from CMU. It also makes people more likely to cheat on the assignments.",
          "I am so disappointed in this class. Peer mentor office hours were only offered Monday - Friday from 11-12 and another hour on Friday. I had to deliberately skip my other classes in order to make office hours because the homework and labs were tough. There should have been more peer mentor office hours offered maybe in the evenings.",
          "This class is hard. Harder than many 300 level classes. The profs weren't amazing but are the best of the 213 instructors. Having taken and dropped this class the year before, it was much better the second time around, due to better instructors and coming in ready to treat it as my hardest class. Go to class, take notes, make sure you deeply understand all the material. Also, the last lab (malloc) is the single hardest assignment I've faced yet in college. My partner and I started a week and a half early, spent over 40 hours on it, and still turned it in half done. This is a necessary class, but be prepared for it.",
          "God",
          "It's very difficult and requires very good time management to pull through.",
          "This class is not as bad as people may make it seem. Nikos and Vincent are great professors and as long as you go to class, you'll do fine. The readings go hand in hand with the lectures so if you cant make a lecture or you want to get ahead, the book is right there. Homeworks aren't bad and help you learn but labs are sometimes really long and not very productive",
          "This course is a very material-heavy approach to system-level CS. It gives you a good knowledge of x86 assembly language and of low-level operations that you don't necessarily think about programming with a higher-level language. There is also a good amount of information and a lab involving low-level security exploits, which was very interesting."

          "Vincent is a great lecturer. The class was really hard, but he did a great job explaining difficult concepts.",
          "you mostly learn on your own through CMU lectures, lectures during class don't help. you learn mostly from doing the homework as well. very large time commitment due to both homework and labs",
          "I very much enjoyed the course, although the workload can be challenging.",
          "This course was difficult but really satisfying. Vincent is great professor. He is super friendly and really ants his students to do well and understand. He is very good at explaining content and answering questions.",
          "This course is a grind but I honestly enjoyed it even as someone who isn't super interested in systems long term. Vincent is an excellent lecturer and genuinely caring individual--take this course with him if you have the opportunity! The malloc lab (Lab 4) is a lot, but as with all the work in this class, if you stay on top of the material, get an early start, work incrementally, and GO TO TA OFFICE HOURS throughout the week you will be okay.",
          "The labs are quite challenging but extremely satisfying once you figure them out! I was very glad to be working with a partner for the homework. This class is definitely hard but exams are open book/notes so if you take good notes/know where material is in the textbook, it isn't too bad.",
          "Vincent is the best! Take any course with him if possible!!!",

          "This is a HARD CLASS. There is a learning curve (especially if you've never taken a systems course before) so don't fall behind in the beginning of the quarter. Once you get through those first few weeks, things starts to connect and the course becomes much more easier to grasp... And then it gets hard again. So basically, just keep on top of your work. Having a partner is great, and although the Peer Mentors aren't always super helpful, Vincent is always welcoming to questions and office hours.",
          "This class was incredible. It was extremely difficult but also very interesting. The material is hard to grasp at first but lectures, homework, and labs really ensure a good understanding. Plus the labs were really fun!",
          "This class is pretty much copied from Carnagie Mellon's CS 213 class. Those notes and lectures help a lot too. St Amour cares about his students which is surprising. TAs don't have enough office hours for you have effective attention and help.",
          "here's the thing. this course is everything you've heard about it: time consuming, life sucking, awful, difficult. but it's also really cool and interesting if you're honest with yourself. really read the textbook (i realized that i would've had an A if i had while studying for the final); start homework early, use https://www.cs.cmu.edu\u2fafs\u02fcs\ufffdmic\u02fclass\ufffd-s17/www/schedule.html for lectures if your teacher is bad at lecturing cuz they use the exact same slides. TA's often had no idea what they were talking about or didn't help, so you really gotta teach yourself, but it's worth it if you do.",

          "oh man. although i think this is a difficult course, it should be OK if you actually come to class and start the assignments early (its no lie, starting them earlly saves u lots of stress). homeworks were easy/medium difficulty but the labs were really tough. what i didnt like was some of the TAs just flat out could not answer questions or explain the concepts, which made the two hours of office hours per day (both at inconvenient times-by the way) sorta useless. the professor spoke a lot about concepts but didnt spend too much time on real examples, which was a shame, but the book has similar questions and solutions you can go off of. FIND A GOOD PARTNER as you two will be spending LOTS of time together. vincent was a good instrucor and lecturer, but i felt like he didnt do enough when i came to him for help. youre gonna have to do a lot of thinking, so be ready. not a class you should take just for fun (unless you dream in assembly code, in which case you probably will take the class regardless of the ctecs). but i didnt think it was as scary as everyone said, as long as you put in your best effort. good luck !!",
          "This class is just a word for word rip from CMU\u2019s online lecture and book. Lectures are merely slides with almost no input from the professor. Questions get pushed off until later in the course. If you don\u2019t have a good group, you\u2019re done. Group work should have less emphasis.",

That being said, Vincent is one of the most understanding and nice professors ever. 213 is going to be miserable no matter what but I really recommend taking it with Vincent as he's just a great guy who wants his students to do well. The exams are really hard!",

          "Hard course, but honestly great. Wasn't even super interested in systems beforehand either. St. Amour is a great professor capable of very good explanations. In addition, this class is taught at like every college, so there are endless other lecture materials if you're struggling (including video lectures from CMU). HW assignments take a while but aren't impossible, same for labs. This class isn't super difficult (as was 212), it just requires a lot of time input to get good results.",

That said, 213 is gonna kick your ass so get ready. I took this alongside 3 other CS courses and I would probably not recommend doing that! The material is interesting and a good intro to this stuff. Make sure you get a reliable partner and get ready to work your butt off. Also, if you want to come into this class with a head start on Assembly language take EECS 205 with Russ!",
          "Very fun and interesting.",
          "Vincent is a good professor and a great guy. However, this class is a ton of work. I knew a bunch of people who have taken this class previously, and from what I can deduce, every quarter this class gets even more and more work. Also, malloc lab was easily the hardest assignment in this class. Many of the TA's were not very helpful because they had not done malloc lab when they took the class. I wish we had had more instruction and guidance on malloc. I felt like I was thrown in the deep end.",
          "Vincent is such a great professor! I was really dreading this class because everyone I know who's taken it has told me how difficult and time-consuming it is, but Vincent made the class very engaging. I was genuinely interested in the material, so I would highly recommend taking this class with Vincent.",
          "Extremely challenging course but extremely rewarding at the same time. This class will push you so hard and you'll spend about six-eight hours most weeks working on the homeworks and the labs, but you come out of it with a much better understanding of how computers work and what the code you write does under the hood. I understand why it's a major requirement, and it should be. Vincent is an outstanding professor and I\u027d highly highly highly recommend taking this course with him.",
          "Make sure you keep up on the homework and lab assignments, doing them as far in advanced as possible is the best option. Readings can be helpful, but resources online can be just as helpful and take less time. Vincent was a good teacher and explained concepts well in lectures but you need to make sure you're paying attention and understanding the material because it will build on itself throughout the quarter and not understanding some of the information may block your further understanding as well",
          "The class is death. You will learn a lot, or fail. This teacher taught it well, but the class will still be death.",
          "This is a tough class! Take it with Vincent though, he is a great lecturer. Make sure you have a partner that will contribute. Start labs early.",
          "This class is as bad as everyone says it is. Exams are open note, but it honestly doesn't really help that much. Start labs and homework early, get a smart partner, and go to every office hour you can. Lecture really blows, but St-Amour has a lot of funny quirks so it's not terrible.",
          "Course was difficult",
          "This is a fantastic course, with a pretty awesome professor. But do not let that mislead you, this class is really hard. If you want an A or even an A-, you gotta grind this course out. There are 4 homework assignments, which are pretty tough (5% of your grade each). Then 4 labs, which are even tougher and take a while to complete (10% of your grade each). The labs are a huge pain and take a ton of time to do, so you HAVE to start early or you will fail them, and considering they're 10% of your grade each, you want to do well on them. Going to class is imperative. If you don't know you won't understand what's going on and won't be able to do any of the labs or the homeworks. You'll also most likely screw up the midterm. Luckily, the midterm and final are really homework based, so if you study those, read the book, and really understand the concepts you should be okay. They are 20% each. Really what you get out of this class is all based on how much you put in. If you don't go the lectures, don't read the book, and don't really try on the homeworks and labs, you will probably learn nothing and do pretty bad. Put in the time, start early on the homework and labs, and you'll be fine. Also, take this course with an easier class schedule. If you take with other tough CS classes, you will get screwed.",
          "The professor made very difficult concepts clearer and enjoyable to learn about.",
          "213 is unavoidably challenging, but Vincent is the man to take it with. He is a truly excellent, competent, and approachable teacher who doesn't just read off the slides (which are themselves great) but simplifies the material's complexity with his own explanations. It is a well-run course at every level, and we rarely went over time in lectures despite his patience in answering questions and clarifying ideas. The readings take a long time and the lectures are generally good enough on their own, but the textbook is exceptional as well. If you are a CS major, I think taking this with Vincent is a no-brainer. This was only his first time running 213 and I've no doubt he will only get better, already being one of the best professors I've had. If you're not required to take this class, I don't think it's an instant \"no\" as it might've been before. With Vincent it feels genuinely engaging and if you pay attention in lectures, there is no way you won't learn a ton about how computers actually work. The labs are no joke but can actually be fun if you don't wait until the last minute. In sum, Vincent is awesome and makes a tough course as enjoyable as could be expected. If you're willing to put in the work, this will probably be the most informative class about computers you've ever taken.",
          "This class is hard. Make sure that you have a strong understanding of the first half so that you do okay on the midterm and have more leeway for the final (where there is more material). The homeworks can take a while but going to office hours is always a good idea. Make sure to do well on the first 3 labs because Malloc is a pain!",
          "This course is hard but Vincent is an amazing teacher.",
          "The structure of the course is based on a course at CMU and I think it's very well done. The labs and homework assignments are very difficult but they prepare you well for the exams and they're very good at solidifying your understanding of the material.",
          "This course will be pretty challenging. Be sure to start early if possible and maintain that lead. After about half the quarter, the course will get pretty busy as each week is a lab or problem set. You will definitely learn a lot and that is dependent on how much you put into the course. The labs are pretty interesting, but office hours for this class can be a life saver. All in all, having the perspective of how programs work at the assembly level can give you quite the insight in your future classes.",
          "This class is hard, but overall the amount of work you put into it correlates with the grade you get (with the exception of the last lab, which honestly you can spend 30+ hours on and still not figure out, and the TAs and professor aren't very helpful for it at all).",
          "This course might have been one of the single hardest courses I have ever taken at Northwestern. That being said, after finishing the course I feel extremely accomplished and really feel like i have a grasp on computer systems and I actually liked the content we were learning. However, bomb lab and malloc will crush your soul (especially especially malloc wow) but you will feel awesome when you are done with them.",
          "This course is HARD. You will learn a lot, but you have to put the effort in if you want to do well. Start assignments as early as possible, don't put them off to the last minute. Vincent is a lovely person. He really cares about his students and wants them to do well.",
          "This course is very time consuming. Labs almost always take around 20 hours to complete, homeworks talks about 10-15. Office hours are helpful sometimes but often they are too crowded and debugging is inherently difficult to get help with. Vincent was a great lecturer and I am very glad I took this course with him! I ended up neglecting my other classes severely in order to complete the work for this one.",

If you do poorly in this class, it probably means computer science isn't for you. Either you enjoy the work and spend the time to do complete it, or you're good at it and don't have to slave over it. Getting 100% on the labs which total to 40% of your grade is doable considering you just need to pass all the tests you are given.",
          "This class was crazy. It wasn't as hard as people say, but it wasn't easy.",
          "This course requires a lot of work but isn't that bad actually. Three out of four of the labs aren't too difficult. The homework can be pretty time-consuming I found but it's worth putting the time into since, at least when I took the class, the exams were a test of whether or not you did the work.",
          "Good class. A lot of content. Vincent is a great teacher. Don't listen to the horror stories because if you follow the steps you'll be absolutely fine. But prepare to sit down for a good number of hours for each lab and homework if you want to succeed or pass the class at all.",
          "Vincent is a god. I've never had Sara but Vincent is hands down the best CS prof I've had at Northwestern. Beyond the cheeky humor and funny anecdotes that he seamlessly works into lecture, he knows so much about the material and explains it so well. I would have done so much worse in this class if someone else had been teaching. There's a lot of material you cover, which is why this class has a hard reputation, but if you plan ahead and manage your time well, it's very easy to get an A in this class. If you can, I recommend taking 203 (with chi haur) the quarter before this class because that will definitely give you an edge for the first midterm.",

However, I understand that a person going into systems would need this class, and how this being a person's first introduction to systems would require the course to cover so much material.",
          "This course is time-consuming but I think Vinvent tried to make the tests easier this quarter, so the class was not as difficult as it has been historically. You still have to put in a lot of work though. Go to office hours",
          "I really enjoyed this class, for both the material and the teaching. Vincent's a great teacher who is patient and really understands the subject to an almost unhealthy degree. The material is challenging but it makes sense, and it all ties together quite well.",
          "hard class",
          "Vincent St amour is a God lecturer. Better than the professors at CMU systems class based on which Northwestern bases this class. The pace of lectures is great to keep you engaged and also help you learn a lot about how a computer works, including hardware, memory allocation, security, and assembly programming.",
          "This class is HARD but also the best class I've taken so far. Read the textbook before class and go to office hours and you will do fine.",
          "This class has a lot of hype around it. I found it really not that hard. The topics are really manageable and the textbook provides a detailed, clear, and relevant explanation for every concept covered in this class. Vince's lectures are engaging and he makes this course entertaining. This is a required class for the CS major, so you'll have to take it. Definitely try to take it with Vince because he is an amazing lecturer. He keeps things focused and too the point, covers all the relevant material, but he also keeps the class light-hearted and goes out of his way to show the importance and interesting elements of the concepts. I learned so much in the class about CS I didn't know before. Beware, this course does have a lot of work. One homework or one lab per week. The labs can be extremely challenging, but they are designed to teach and not to bore. Some of the labs were actually quite interesting. You will learn a lot in this class if you can keep up with the workload.",
          "Great class despite being copied from CMU. Vincent is great and knows his stuff. Take with him if it's a required class. Labs and homeworks will boost grades although exams aren't as hard as they were in the past from what I've heard",
          "A challenging and intensive course. Expect to struggle and learn.",
          "Harder than 212 and 214 but still a reasonable class. Vincent was a great instructor. PAY ATTENTION IN CLASS AND CONSULT THE TEXTBOOK FOR HELP ON THE HOMEWORK. Office hours were very useful too.",
          "EECS 213 is tricky, even when you are able to understand the material with a great professor like Vincent. His lectures really help to clarify the readings that you definitely SHOULD DO, but otherwise you can go to office hours since Vincent more or less keeps the same TAs for 213 quarter to quarter. The four homeworks are worksheets that take some time and the four labs take forever. Highly recommend office hours for the labs.",
          "It was good",
          "This is an amazing class, and Vincent is an amazing instructor who really cares about students learning - he is not only very well versed in what he's teaching, but he is great at transmitting it. He met with me twice individually to go over topics I was interested in that were only tangentially related to the class. He is a great guy and will go above and beyond to help you understand all the important concepts of 213.",
          "Goes though a lot of challenging material in a short amount of time. Ask whenever something is not clear because it will happen. Make sure both you and your partner prioritize this class because you will struggle.",
          "Material is challenging but also interesting. Vincent is a good teacher.",
          "St-Amour is very upfront with how challenging this class is. The homework makes you think and might take some office hour questions but is generally very approachable. The labs are more challenging and will require a lot of time and mental effort, not to mention a number of office hours. Be sure to find a good partner that will contribute to both types of assignments. Thankfully, if you generally understand the material, the exams are fine. While not everyone may be super into the low-level software and hardware inner workings of computer systems, they're important concepts to understand and at least have a general idea about and I think will prove to be very useful in the future. Taking EECS 205 helps in the beginning since there's a lot of assembly.",
          "Vincent is an incredible professor and this class is super cool. If you opt in and commit to focusing in class and staying on top of the work, you will really enjoy this class and learn a whole lot. It gets hyped up as being incredibly difficult, but if you go to class, read the textbook, and stay on top of the assigned work, it is actually really manageable. Great course! Don't be afraid of it! Just put the time in!",
          "This course knocked me out. Once I stopped reading the textbook though it bacame a lot more manageable. Getting a good lab partner is the most important thing you can do.",
          "This course is as promised, a hard class in a rewarding subject.",
          "this course is a necessary evil but st-armour is a chill guy and a good professor. the homeworks really help you learn, and the midterms aren't weighted as much as the labs and homeworks",
          "Prof is great for this course. Content can be dry at times but is fantastic if you're interested in\u02fcurious about computers. Tests are fair overall. Labs and homework are very hard but not unmanageable. All content covered in class is posted online.",
          "Course is hard but survivable. Assignments take a while and you will likely need to go to office hours for them. Lectures are very long and difficult to apply to actual problems as they base off of concept instead of actual application.",
          "This class is exactly what you're told to expect. Brutally challenging, but honestly manageable if you handle it responsibly. Do not underestimate the labs, they are extremely difficult. Homework can also be tricky, but prepares you so that you can get an passing grade and keep limping toward the finish line of what will probably be one of the toughest classes you ever take. You definitely learn a ton.",
          "I know most students won't be able to do this, but I found it really helpful to drop the class and then retake it; it was about 3x easier the second time around. The labs are definitely a challenge, but the majority of the peer mentors are really helpful. Vincent is extremely helpful in office hours and will take the time to make sure that you understand the concepts. The tests vary in difficulty. Getting started early is a really good piece of advice, but it might not be feasible if you're doing other classes. I liked this textbook more than any other CS textbook I've had; make sure to read it, and the practice problems help a lot with the homework.",
          "This is a difficult class, but you really get out of it what you put in. Your lab partner can definitely make or break your experience and you need to go to class.",
          "This class is pretty time intensive but also very valuable. The labs in particular were pretty tough. I enjoyed this class overall.",
          "The most time-consuming intro eecs class by far but it's very interesting. The labs are hard but solving them gives off a great sense of accomplishment. The exams are not hard, compared to other components of the class. Also, Vincent is a great lecturer. The only challenge is not to fall asleep to his melodic voice",
          "Wow. So, the lectures and the labs are straight up plagiarized from Carnegie Mellon. That leaves us with 2 things that the professor can give an honest effort of preparing: homeworks and exams. Both were awful. Homeworks were often off-subject and wrong, while the exams were too easy and interestingly subjective. You could lose a lot of points depending on how you understood the questions since the were no partial points and the questions were not clear. Overall extremely disappointed that the teaching staff gave 0 effort in a course that should've been one of the most interesting courses in Northwestern. I would say don't take it but do you have a choice?",
          "Overall, the concepts of the course are not necessarily that hard or complicated, there are just many small details to keep track of. Generally, the class takes a lot of time, but if you can spend enough time on the class, it should not be very hard. Vincent is a good teacher, and office hours are very useful to help get through the homework and labs."

          "Easy A, really boring.",
          "This class is harder than it used to be, but still pretty easy if one person in your group knows how to code JS or HTML. Interesting content, but not presented in the best way tbh.",
          "The class isn't too hard. The main feature is a group project where your group has to design a UI. You can think of it like a DTC project, but with less work required. The HW's are pretty easy, but are used mainly to get you acquainted with the tools and design philosophies you will be using in your group project. The project was written in HTML\u02fcSS/Javascript. The first couple weeks are used as an intro to the languages used for the project, while the rest of the quarter is used for the design philosophies and other DTC-esque topics, leaving you to figure out the rest of the programming languages. This isn't so bad, though, as they teach you enough to get the project done, and there is a in depth documentation page for the languages you can use for any questions about the languages.",
          "Good",
          "Good EECS course. Four relatively easy assignments plus one group project throughout the quarter, the workload wasn't to difficult or too much. Much of the material from the class is intuitive though.",

          "Easy but interesting class. A few individual HW assignments and the rest is a group project, which is very manageable.",
          "Overall, this class was super easy and Professor Horn is great. If you're looking to be challenged and to learn alot, this class isn't for you. If you're looking for an easy and fun class, then you should take this class.",
          "This course was extremely enjoyable, and it's nice to see the teacher get so excited about design! My favorite lecture was the typography lecture. You'll have to learn HTML and CSS by yourself, but it's not too bad. Make sure to get a good group for the project though.",

As an international student, this kind of group work helps me not only practice my front-end programming skill, but also gives me a chance to work with the students from other culture. I meet lots of friends at the end of the course. Besides, the course covers all aspects of web page design including from graphic design to the De Morgan design principal. I not only learned the engineering knowledge but also the principal of design.",

Easy class, make sure to go to class and find a good group for the project. Otherwise, it's a breeze.",

However, the lectures are uninteresting and I never went to class for several reasons. (1) the lecturer seems tired and disinterested (2) each class tries to cover a large topic (like fonts\u02fcolors), and does so in a very introductory and obvious way. Still loved the class, easy too.",
          "Only took this course to fulfill the interface requirement in the CS major. Nonetheless, the class is fairly good and probably the best class that satisfies the interface requirement for CS majors.",
          "Yes, the course helped me. It teaches basics of web development and very useful to students who want to develop applications. It teaches the rules for making good interfaces.",
          "Wasn't a huge fan of this class. Built around a quarter long web development group project. You only need to build a pretty simple interface but most of the html\u02fcss you use is self taught. Pretty light workload for a 300 level EECS class.",
          "Easy and interesting class, no exams, projects\u02fassignments are not hard or time-consuming",

          "Great course to take, it's essentially CS-oriented design 101. Learned a lot about web dev and norman design principles, which are actually all around us! Course involved a quarter long project done in groups, which centers around some these (which is quite broad). Overall fun class to take.",
          "This class was very fascinating. I learned a lot; it teaches some really important skills. Some thoughts: The class itself is basically DTC for web development. It focuses primarily on web design\u2fdevelopment, which is really a tiny fraction of the entirety of HCI. Great web development class, poor HCI class. Segal offers better courses in HCI, etc. Keep track of your assignments. They are few and far between, and worth a low amount of points. But the whole class is low point scoring, so missing one can really affect your grade.",

          "This class was really good if you are interested in a very general survey of Human Computer Interaction. The class has changed considerably from past quarters and actually is a substantial amount of work (the project prototype checkpoints take a lot of planning, groupwork, and hours of coding if you put in your best effort). Homeworks 3 and 4 seemed kind of forced and contrived (felt like busy work). I feel like it was difficult to get much out of the lectures because the topics were very general. For example, we only spent one lecture on the entire topic of data visualization and one lecture on the topic of A\u02fb testing. I'm hoping that in the future they reduce the scope of the class so that they can focus on fewer topics in depth.",

          "Use HTML, CSS, and JS to create interfaces. Not difficult in terms of coding, but work can get tedious sometimes. I thought that an excessive amount of points were often docked off for the slightest mistake on assignments. Nell however does genuinely care about this subject and is very approachable. Easy to get an A if you submit assignments on time and do them decently well.",

          "330 is a cool course to get a start in HCI. Honestly, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. The only qualm I have against the course is mandatory attendance. The result of mandatory attendance is people just sitting on their computers the entire time, which is incredibly distracting to me. Projects were interesting, and allowed students to actually do something they were interested in.",
          "This was a great course. Focused on a quarter long project, so it is important to work with a good group. A few other homework assignments in addition to the project help you learn the coding basis in html, css, and javascript that you will use for the project. Overall a lot of fun!",

The quarter-long project of designing a website is fantastic- it's great to have a high-quality deliverable like that at the end of the quarter. This class does have a lot of busy work, however. Much of the material covered in lectures was not interesting or very valuable. Several of the assignments were more time-consuming than they were worthwhile. This class does take a lot of work, and not all of it is valuable. However, it is a good introduction to web design.",

Similar to DTC (for any engineers) but with no real client interaction, just a more nebulous user-centered design process.",

BASICALLY, they don't want to give everyone A's, so for us they made getting full points only possible for 2 students of the 20 in a discussion section. What they were really trying to say was \"some projects are worse than others, the better ones get full points.\" BUT, they didn't say that. Watch out.",

Anything that is taught during lecture is a watered down version of what you learn in DSGN 306 (UX Design).",

The team assignments were harsh for me because my team did not contribute at all really to the project and the course is structured so that there is nothing you can do when your group does not contribute.

One time we looked at pictures of different doors to demonstrate visibility. One time we sketched. This would be fine if the individual hw and group project weren't so coding intensive. How can you expect to not teach us any HTML\u02fcSS and have us do the hw perfectly? Also the grading rubric for this class is TERRIBLE AND ARBITRARY. The rubric literally limits the number of students who can get full marks on an assignment, no matter how good it is. It's absurd. I learned nothing and didn't even get an easy A.",
          "What makes or breaks the course can be the group you are working with. Try to look for a well balanced group that is organized. Each lecture introduces a new concept on designing UI if you are really interested in that area. The classes can be interactive also as interesting design problems are asked sometimes.",
          "It did focus on UI design theories, and maybe I needed that to have the basics.",
          "Fairly easy EECS class if you keep up with the work and have a decent team. The design concepts covered are essentially a rehashing of what you've already seen in DTC (if you're in McCormick). You will not learn any coding in class, although you're expected to create a prototype using fairly intermediate html, CSS, and javascript; so, either start learning those languages ahead of time, or find a group with someone who already knows them. You will not have much time in the heat of the quarter to become nearly enough familiar with these languages to make a quality prototype.",
          "If you don't care about not learning anything and want an easy A, this is the class for you. Lectures are like DTC lectures but about websites. All the HTML\u02fcSS/Javascript is supposed to be learned on your own. First 2 assignments are fun and help you learn, the rest are a timesink and dont teach you anything.",
          "Easy-ish course. They're super nitpicky on the homework assignments which is weird because it seems like the rubric is structured not to measure your understanding of the topic, but rather just to try to take away points form students. You're also at a huge advantage if you have prior frontend experience (HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, etc).",
          "This is an easy 300 level class. Very time consuming. Very TA dependent, so if you have a bad TA you are out of luck. Ask your TA what the rubric is or else you will lose marks for no reason.",
          "This course is horrible. Do NOT take it. Literally 5 minutes were spent teaching you how to code in 3 brand new languages and everything else you had to teach yourself. You don't learn anything in the lectures. There are reading quizzes during every single class and there's a password on the quiz so you have to show up to class to take the quiz",
          "Not too hard. You don't really need to go to lectures.",
          "Good topics to learn, but rather very easy.",
          "The content of the class was very easy but the grading is so subjective, that getting an A is not easy as it may seem. Professor won't teach you HTML, CSS, or JS but teach you about elements of design and you pretty much learn the languages on your own (and coming from someone who didn't touch the languages before hand, it was not bad at all). There is a quarter-long project and if you have a solid group where the work is mostly divided evenly, getting an A won't be hard. There are no exams.",
          "I like the class, although there are lots of small things you need to do every week.",
          "I thought that in the beginning of the course when we were learning about HTML and CSS it was pretty interesting but once we got into the last 60% of the course it got very uninteresting. We were forced to go to lecture because there were daily quizzes but I believe if that hadn't been the case then the lecture hall would've been almost empty every day",
          "made me write code for the first few weeks.",
          "Most CTECs are gonna be from people who went into this with an established group and worked with them. That's all well and good but if it's not the case with you, or you don't already have an HCI idea you're dying to build, it'll be significantly less enjoyable. Lectures are simply not engaging and if not for the in-class quizzes 80% of people wouldn't go. The readings are easy and fairly interesting so I would suggest doing them despite being totally unnecessary for said quizzes. You will have to learn HTML\u02fcSS + JS yourself as the guidance on them you receive from the class is basically non-existent. I don't know. This class is the kind where putting in minimal effort makes it virtually impossible to get lower than a B, but don't believe people that say it's a \"guaranteed\" A. And don't expect the work to be that interesting rather than a slog to get through.",
          "This course is not a coding course, teacher only talks about many abstract but but not very useful notions. You should not except any systematic knowledge about coding. And your score is not string related to your coding skill. I pay most of my attention on coding but teacher and TAs just grade your writing in some way. So if you like listening to notions and writing and presentation, this course is fine. But if you want to learn like HTML,CSS or JS, this course is not the best choice.",
          "Really enjoyed the hands on side of this class and the iterative design and testing. Fun to build a website, but make sure you have a good group. Lectures were not that helpful to the project or learning web development and were often common sense.",
          "Pretty easy EECS class, lecture attendance is basically mandatory because of the daily reading quizzes but the homework is all easy busy-work. The majority of this class is the HCI project, so make sure you like your group.",
          "Not the most informative class, lecture wise, but it challenged our team in terms of coming up with an idea and developing that.",
          "This course was really easy, at times it felt like two separate classes: the lectures and the project\u02fdiscussion sections. Having a good group really made the class more enjoyable, but the lectures were still pretty uninteresting and were essentially the same material as the readings. The website project was really fun to do but I ended up having to teach myself JavaScript, Git, etc.",
          "They changed the curriculum, and the TAs really tried to nitpick this quarter to create a normal grade distribution.",
          "The class is quite a joke. The class focuses on just the mundane design aspects but never really applies Javascript/JQuery lessons. Everything is pretty much self-taught and the daily in-class quizzes are pointless.",
          "This course is pretty easy and can be fun depending on your project group! It's more time consuming if you're not familiar with HTML\u02fcSS/JS but the first few weeks do a decent job of catching everyone up to speed enough that anyone can confidently work on their project.",
          "learnt so much, but lecture was not always that helpful or necessary",
          "This course takes up much more time than I expected. There are homeworks on design concepts that take a decent amount of time and are graded pretty harshly, and there is a massive project that has many parts, all of which are also graded pretty harshly. It is extremely difficult to get an A in this class (this is a change from last year). Often your project seems like a great idea at the beginning and then becomes extremely difficult to create, and doesn\u2019t fit with the point of the class.",
          "I enjoyed the class, and you get the chance to teach yourself how to code on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.",
          "They tried to make this class \"harder\" by giving obnoxious mandatory reading quizzes every class and grading assignments in a ridiculous manner. The lectures aren't worth going to, most of the project assignments are busywork that isn't related to interfaces, and the personal assignments are annoying. I came in with prior knowledge and learned nothing from this class- I absolutely recommend NOT TAKING this with Nell in the winter.",
          "Once upon a time, 330 was known throughout the EECS major for being the most cartoonishly easy class in the major. When faced with how to change this, the admins/teacher decided not to add new content, but rather to simply make standards massively harsher and add a lot more assignment for a class that still has the same cartoonishly low amount of content it always did. If you are looking for an easy class, don't take this because it takes a LOT of time and is very difficult. If you're looking for a challenging class, also don't take this because it won't teach you anything despite all the challenge. Basically just avoid this dumpster fire in general. This class has gone through two incarnations, hopefully it goes through a third because it is very needed.",
          "Class time was so poorly utilized by the professor. It would have been so much more beneficial to learn how to code in HTML and Java to optimize user experience. Instead, lectures covered things that seemed so common sense. Pretty easy though and project was fun.",
          "Get a good group, divide work equitably--there will be many prototypes, many testings, many write-ups.",
          "The course is not difficult but intensive. The project is focused on design interface more than the functionalities of your web application. The guidelines followed by the TAs are usually strict. But a lot t learn if interested towards learning sciences.",
          "It helps me a lot in HCI.",
          "Very cool class, Prof O'rourke hits all the relevant topics, the assignments are kinda tedious but everything is interesting and relevant to different parts of the human-computer interaction field",
          "Wish there were more coding aspects of the class. Not very exciting or difficult material",
          ".",
          "I was unfortunately disappointed with this class. The assignments were very long, and short/overlapping deadlines and strict requirements meant that this course gave unnecessary stress where it wasn't needed. The group project assignments were graded unnecessarily harsh and forced groups to constantly meet up outside of class to fulfill basic requirements. Lectures were interesting but dry, and the reading quizzes didn't feel like they added to my learning. My TA took a long time to grade assignments and constantly arrived late to studio and office hours. This course really needs to place less of an emphasis on fitting so much material into a short period of time and should focus more about getting students equipped with the skills necessary to approach emerging topics in HCI. It is clear that Nell and the TAs are passionate about HCI, and I hope this class can improve for the next time.",
          "Good class. Not too hard. I basically built our website by myself and I still wasn't overwhelmed and I still really liked the class",
          "I was very confused about the grading rules.",
          "I loved it! Got to learn HTML\u02fcSS/JS although it was self-taught, the class gave me a reason to learn it",
          "This class is known for being super easy, so while I do appreciate their efforts to make it a little more rewarding, which I didn't mind, I do think they messed up by not actually teaching us the coding languages properly. The homework that required coding was something I went into completely blind because I had never coded before, so I was annoyed that we were forced to just Google everything. I'm not paying tuition to just Google. The project requirements were fine, but the busywork wasn't helpful. And finally, those quizzes every class were the most annoying and useless thing I've ever had to do in a class. Not only do people skip class intentionally and just get the code from their friends, people just answer randomly on the questions and it just takes time up. Completely useless.",
          "Not an interesting course for me. Much more design-focused and oriented.",
          "Don't take it with Prof O' Rouke!!! You don't learn much, and have to put so much effort and time into your project. But, you don't get anything out of it because it is what you can do in your free time. Even grading is very harsh, so it is not worth it.",
          "There were a lot of assignments. They're not very difficult, but the class was a lot more work than I expected. Having reading quizzes during each lecture was excessive, and not that helpful. The content of the course was very intuitive. It did not seem necessary to spend a lot of time engaging with the material.",
          "Worst class I've taken at Northwestern. This class encompasses how much the NUCS curriculum needs to improve. O'Rourke is not a bad professor, but this course is just so badly taught. The class is called human-computer interaction, which is basically \"how to build a good-looking and interactive web app.\" But the prof spent literally 10 minutes on HTML and CSS, and NONE on Javascript. There were 2 homework assignments that were decently difficult if you had no CSS or HTML experience. Luckily, I did, so I did not struggle too much in this class, but I would have liked to learn the cooler tips and tricks regarding CSS, HTML, Javascript, and web development in general. None of this was taught, and I can't imagine how hard it was for students who came in with no CSS, HTML experience. O'Rourke spent a whole lecture literally going over font types, sizes, and colors. What a waste. Do not take this class if you have no HTML, CSS experience; most likely you will find it quite difficult, and also they grade tough. If your margins are off like 1px, they take off 1 point (homework assignments out of 20). There are no tests which are nice, the \"final\" is really just building a web app prototype using HTML, CSS, and Javascript given a specific idea and purpose. At the end of the quarter, you have to give a 7-minute presentation about your web app and the problem it addresses. The whole process of building this prototype is similar to DTC, where you have to do user testing, etc. Think of this class as a jank, waste of time web development version of DTC. Wouldn't recommend.",
          "Some take it because it teaches you 'html\u02fcss and javascript'. Please don't take this class for that reason. It teaches you the bare minimum of it. This class is about learning how users would interact with your product, and if you are not interested in this topic this class will bore you out of your mind. The TAs are also horrid in programming either since they are not expected to be good programmers.",
          "I greatly enjoyed this course, the material was interesting and not extremely challenging but you could put in more work if you wanted to get as much as you can out of the class",
          "This course got a lot harder than it used to be, and therefore it was harder than most people expected. Was a reasonable amount of work if you had a good group (make sure you have a good group, try not to be the only CS major in your group!!), was a LOT of work if you had a bad group. Grading was pretty harsh, seemed like there was an effort to make this not an easy A anymore. Which basically meant grading things really harshly to prevent as many people from getting A's, which felt unfair at times.",
          "Great class overall. It is pretty easy but still would take quite a lot of time, as any front-end development. Students are put in groups of 4 for a quarter long project. A lot depends on your team, try to arrange responsible teammates.",
          "The entire class is a group project in which you implement an application of your own. There is a lot of freedom, but it is a bit difficult if you've never coded in HTML\u02fcSS before because they don't teach it in class. The TA's are pretty helpful, but there isn't a lot of time for the project so you want to make sure you're on top of your stuff. The grading is a little annoying because the TAs are only allowed to give a certain amount of each grade.",
          "I liked how this class was structured. Also, it's very important to go into this class with friends you know won't slack off, since the entire course is based on one cumulative project. I loved my group, so I did well. Others may not have. Also, lectures were fairly useless, and I found that learning about paper prototyping was not really useful to creating a computer prototype.",
          "Everything taught in this class can be self-learned easily. In fact, the class is set up in a way that forces you to self-learn, especially HTML\u02fcSS and JavaScript. So ask yourself, why spend tuition money on this class? Maybe only if you want a moderately easy A (not too easy though) or if you're interested in doing an HCI project.",
          "Good course, but bad implementation of grading. The topic of the course was easy and straightforward, and if you have a good group, the class shouldn't be difficult. However, the grading was unfair. Only 2 people from each discussion section were allowed to get an A on any given assignment (according to my TA). I wish we had spent more time on actually learning javascript. But other than that, it is a fairly easy course, its a good supplement for taking with hard classes like 213 or 212. I\u027d recommend it though! Nell was a super nice professor and I enjoyed her lectures event though sometimes the material was a little boring.",
          "The course wasn't very involved.",
          "TA was quite mean, which is the awful feeling all through the course",
          "The project is really fun and interesting.",
          "Assignments could be really time consuming, and not much direction was given for the actual computer science aspect of this course, so I would recommend being familiar with HTML\u02fcSS/JavaScript before taking this. Grading was sometimes harsh and/or unclear because they don't want the mean to be too high.",
          "This class has a policy of artifically curving down since only two people can get a perfect score on a single assignment per studio section. Take that as you will.",
          "This class has gotten a LOT harder apparently. This had made the projects significantly better but don't expect an easy A.",
          "The group is divided by studio, if you would like to have fixed partners, be careful to have same studio with each other. The course are mostly introductions for the graphic design principle for HCI, focusing on the website front end.",
          "It's cool that you get to create your own application throughout the quarter but I felt that the teaching style and evaluation methods could be greatly improved. Your grade is based entirely on homeworks and your project checkpoints with no exams, with lectures mainly rehashing the readings, so lectures seemed pretty superfluous. Furthermore, the lecture quizzes were intended to encourage lecture attendance but because everyone had their computers out, people weren't focused on the professor and overall lectures didn't seem to add much to the class, which seems pretty counterintuitive for any class. Also, although the readings and the professor teaches concepts on design concepts, they spend very little time teaching you the actual tools (HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.) and you're forced to self-learn ALL of it, which made the project difficult because you know what it's supposed to look like but have no instruction on how to get there or how to write efficient code. You learn nothing of Bootstrap or JQuery, which end up being extremely important for the project. I think a lot of students come into the class hoping to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript, and other tools to create websites, and the fact that we spend so much time learning the theory behind HCI but not the tools doesn't make much sense and puts at a disadvantage the students who don't have prior experience in those coding areas.",
          "Group project is the main component of the class. Great instruction, engagement, feedback, and fair grading overall.",
          "This course helped me learn about human centered design and design thinking. This course did not help me learn about web technologies.",
          "Do not take this course if you want to learn HTML/ CSS/ JavaScript. I went into this course already knowing a lot about any of these topics. Everything I learned from this course about HTML/ CSS/ JavaScript was things I learned by myself for the quarter project. The course material is almost all about human centered design and design concepts. This was frustrating because there was a disconnect from the course material and the testing of our websites in discussion. There are online canvas quizzes for the readings every lecture.",
          "The course is trivial. Every week you have to take two little quiz and complete part of the project by using HTML, CSS and Javascript. And you have to write lots of paper.",
          "This class forces you to learn HTML/Javascript on your own because it isn't taught. That is the main part of the class and is essential for the project. The lectures did not teach you anything if you actually do the readings for the quizzes.",
          "HCI is a super interesting subject, but that doesn't really translate well into a large lecture class, although it's evident that Nell is trying. The assignments are fine, but be wary of grade deflation. The TA's are very picky with grading.",
          "GPA booster. This can be an interesting class, and you'll learn web dev principles. It's not as \u27easy' as people say, and you do have to put in the hours to do well. Lectures however are just recounts of the readings, and were not informative at all for the most part, and reading quizzes in lecture means you still have to attend. Interesting content, but not the best taught course at NU.",
          "Not bad. Project could be annoying at times. Most lectures were not directly relevant to project.",
          "The in-class quizzes existed solely to check attendance, and definitely did not help with learning. Lectures essentially summarized the required reading, and there was very little actual programming instruction provided or required for the main assignment\u2014which seemed unusual for a project class. Grading frequently did not have explanations given for seemingly arbitrary number scores.",
          "You learn how to build a website which isn't the most exciting application for HCI but it's a useful skill; Nell was a good lecturer.",

          "Take this course with Ian! He is a great professor and has a passion for teaching.",
          "Class was not well executed. Ian can be seen around campus writing the slides for that day's lectures minutes before each lecture.. Typos upon typos upon more mistakes in lecture. Slides were also very boring and the exams didn't reflect what you learned about data structures as much as it did Ian's favorite algorithms. Logistics of the class were even worse. Many people get straight 0's on assignments because of \"compiling errors\" which are not the students' fault. Then when asking Ian for a second opportunity to submit he says okay but he has to dock off half the potential points.",
          "Great class. Take it with Ian and hopefully Ethan. They're both amazing. Be SUPER careful you follow the guidelines on homework or they will give you a zero! Homework can be easy or challenging but nothing impossible. Quizzes are fair, just read carefully and remember concepts above code! (though, do remember some code!). It's a great class you will most definitely enjoy :)",
          "Only liked it bc of ian. Please be sure to stay on top of the assignments or you WILL go down a letter grade. Harder than it looks. Also, no communication in this class. I didn't even know you could resubmit assignments you got a 0 on until during finals week, and it wasn't even mentioned in class.",
          "Ian #1. Homework assignments can take awhile, write a lot of tests for them. Extensions were life-saving.",
          "The course is interesting, and Ian makes it fun. The exams and grading are very fair. The weekly assignments are hard, but fun to do.",
          "yes",
          "The homeworks in this class were a little annoying but the exams are super easy.",
          "The cutoff for an A is a 94",
          "Do not stop trying in this class! The first half will lull you into a sense of security then BAM! you're deep into priority queues and amortized analysis wondering what just happened.",
          "Course was very manageable, really good lecture slides, should take it with Ian.",
          "I absolutely loved this course, some of my favorite coding because it's really relevant and challenging enough, but not too overly frustrating. Probably the easiest of the 212, 213 214 core courseload for CS. Would highly recommend, especially with Horswill because his hair is fabulous and he's generally the best.",
          "Ian's a good dude! He's probably the guy to take this with.",
          "This class provides some of the key fundamentals to data structures and algorithm. The content of the class itself is actually not too challenging, and Prof. Horswill does a great job in helping you navigate through the material, and letting you know what material is actually important and relevant to you. I felt that the lecture slides were some of the best I've ever seen, so much so, that many students (I would say most students) elect not to attend lecture. That being said, I personally think he is quite good at lecturing and you should try to attend lectures whenever possible.",
          "",
          "The exams are not too difficult. If you attend lectures and is diligent about keeping up with the material, you should have no problems completing the class. It is extremely important to understand the concepts LIFO (Last In First Out) and FIFO (First In Last Out). This will help you grasp the fundamentals of some of the data structures pretty quickly.",
          "",
          "The assignments are also not too difficult, but you should be spending hours (8-11) per week on them regardless. Some assignments could take less time (4-8 hours) but I encourage you to spend a few hours understanding the assignment, going through the lecture slides to understand the material, then proceed in starting the assignment. Once you understand the material, the assignments are not too difficult, because a lot of the pseudocode for the data structures are included in the slides. You will learn to debug through these assignments and it is an extremely useful skill.",
          "N\u02fa",
          "This class was very thorough and while it wasn't the easiest, I definitely learned a lot. Of course, some of the assignments took a while to complete but most of them were pretty straightforward and were a good representation of the material we learned in class (aside from 1). I would definitely recommend 214.",
          "It was a bit of a challenge but also taught a lot.",
          "Take it with Ian and Ethan. They are fantastic instructor and TA. Assignment have bigger portion than I expected and when you screwed up one or two, really need to work hard on exams. but overall, it's a very enjoyable class.",
          "Ian is an excellent lecturer. He's charismatic, enthusiastic about the material, highly knowledgeable, and always wanting to answer questions. The lecture aspect of the course was fine. The homework assignments were sufficiently challenging enough but not too hard. The automated grading system seemed to cause a great amount of distress to many students including myself because a single misspelling or wrong access modifier might end up in an assignment getting a 0. They did however warn of this in all of the homework documents and encouraged all students to double check their assignments. The tests were quite fair and tested pure understanding of concepts rather than memorization.",
          "I think this course is what you make of it. If you really try on the homeworks, you will understand all the concepts and learn a lot throughout the quarter.",
          "The projects are super easy but its hard to think of all the edge cases to test for so its easy to lose points. Also lectures are fine but hard to be engaging given how slow the pace of the class is. I think this could be combined with 211 easily, at least for people with previous experience.",
          "Really fun material and Ian and Ethan are both great",
          "Good course, class can be a bit repetitive and and a lot of time is spent on concepts you wont be expected to know or going into detail far beyond what you'll be asked to implement in the homework or quizzes. Assignments are pretty short and easy compared to other EECS classes, and Ian's quizzes are good evaluations of understanding and easy to prep for. Good class.",
          "DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE ASSIGNMENTS! It's not like 211 or 111. 100% is not guaranteed. some averages were 50. Its a tough class. quizzes are reasonable but assignments are super hard. TAKE THIS WITH HORSWILL",
          "The assignments in this class are graded way too harshly. I have gotten multiple low grades for small C# specific errors, miss-capitalizing method names and inconsequential stuff like that. We should spend time going over what people did wrong in the homework instead of useless discussion sections. Never have I aced a final and expect to get a C in the class.",
          "Definitely take 214 with Ian. He teaches it in C#, which is very similar to C++. Most of the coding assignments use pseudocode that they give you in the lecture slides so it's not too difficult. The testing schedule kind of sucks though. There are midterms weeks 6 and 10, and then a final in the class, which just feels unnecessary.",
          "Class is relatively easy at the beginning but picks up in the last 2-3 weeks. Assignments also really range, and visual studios is not fun to work with especially with a mac. Make sure you know how to turn your homeworks in because a lot of people struggle with that. Similar to 211 in time spent coding, just like all EECS classes in that if you don't have prior experience with the language (C#) this class won't be a breeze.",
          "Fun class, and Ian's great. However, one big problem with this class (and the other intro CS classes) is that code is autograded, without being looked at by an instructor. As a result, the importance of writing readable and documented code, top-down design, etc. is completely lost. Since most of the assignments pretty much involve copying code from slides and filling in blanks, students don't really learn how to code in this class. However, the instructors do a good job of making the assignments interesting, and it is a good class overall. Ian and Ethan explain concepts well.",
          "As usual, Ian is a great professor who can clearly articulate various topics. Assignments are done individually, but because the slides from lecture are posted online and contain pseudocode, they're easy to complete.",
          "I think it's great I learned a ton! It's a lot of work in my opinion though.",
          "Great class if you don't have a busy quarter. Workload was pretty overwhelming for me.",
          "This class is hard. Assignments take forever and are harshly graded. I spent most of the time teaching myself the material for assignments and the quizzes. Assignments were weekly, which was so hard to keep up with the pace of the course.",
          "This is an extremely important class for computer science majors and I believe that it was taught very well. I can't imagine taking the course with anyone other than Ian, and hes just a blast when he's lecturing. The class, in my opinion, is difficult conceptually and you really just need to work at it and make sure you understand everything since it all builds on each other.",
          "Very fun",
          "The class is great. Ian's lectures can feel a bit dry at time and slides are not always the most intuitive.",
          "Don't forget to register for extensions. The late policy kind of sucks!",
          "Very disorganized class this year for some reason. We spent hours debugging a game we never used for homeworks, the homeworks were usually graded slowly, and the test results were in spanish, but that didnt even matter because the test results were just the names of the test, not the inputs and outputs. Lectures were well done and informative, but you learn by doing and the hw side was awful.",
          "This is the class you need for interviews. 213 is an absolute grind but 214 is actually pretty enjoyable and interesting. You should go to each lecture and do the assignments ahead of time. It will definitely help you learn. If you've done actual coding before this class is a breeze but it covers some really pertinent topics. Half of software development is dealing with data and how to represent it. This should really be the first CS class you take after 211.",
          "Ian is a great dude and a pretty decent teacher. The slides get really clunky (one of the lectures has like 240 slides!) so they really only make sense if you go to lecture.",
          "As someone with no previous coding experience, I found this course extremely challenging. There are a lot of people in the class who have coded before and make it seem easy, so the concepts aren't always explained fully and the homeworks were very difficult if you didn't have background knowledge. Taking this course made me realize I didn't want to continue to pursue EECS, would not recommend unless necessary for a major/minor",
          "Fine course. Many things to learn, but not too difficult. Ian is a great teacher. Sometimes there's broken homework code, though.",
          "Very interesting subject, Ian is great at teaching, Ethan is a great TA. My biggest complaint is how easy it is to make a tiny mistake on homework submission and have your grade drop to a zero because of it.",
          "The HW's were much more difficult than in previous quarters, in previous 214 classes you had a partner and in this course it seemed like working together was slightly discouraged. I think the HW assignments themsevles were all very interesting, however, they did not tell you specifically what tests your code was going to be compared to, so you really just had to try your best and hope your code was up to their standards. I understand this is a smart way to make students think critically, but it was also very challenging considering how much lower our HW averages were in comparison to other quarters. The lectures were very dry but the two did their best to make it interesting. the exams and weekly quizzes were beyond fair.",
          "This class is great. Ian and Ethan are great. I learned a lot in this class and it didn't take up very much of my time. Also some words of wisdom - don't be late to the last day of class.",
          "The class is very manageable and if you enjoy this class you'll probably enjoy the major/minor.",
          "I enjoyed this class. I think that the lectures and slides were adequate with helping to learn everything that Ian wanted to teach. Ethan was a great TA. The homeworks were challenging and took a long time, but I felt that they helped me learn the concepts. The quizzes were all very fair.",
          "Ian's great, Ethan is a great TA. If you did well in 211 you'll do well and if you struggled in 211 you will probably struggle again.",
          "The actual material in this class is extremely interesting and useful and I did learn a lot from this class. There were however constant issues and confusions with homeworks which led to unnecessary stress. It made it feel like the class was built for you to do poorly because of all the issues with homeworks. Issues with homeworks grades took forever to fix. Also we had two midterms with no class in-between which seemed unnecessary and like bad planning. OVERALL very interesting course just very poorly run.",
          "This quarter (2018 spring), the workload of this course increased a LOT compared to previous sections. In the past, you only need to implement several functions in a well-written skeleton, and only need to write tests for those functions. However, for this quarter, we need to write up pretty much everything without any skeletons, and therefore need to write more tests for every thing we write.",
          "For the three quizzes, they are not very difficult, and people generally do well.",
          "The grading for the homework is super slow, which is a bit annoying.",
          "Ian is an awesome professor. He teaches the concepts and implementations really well. Except that he talks rather slow in lectures, which makes me drowsy, but I suppose this is causing problem only for very few people like me who tend to fall asleep when professors speak slowly.",
          "The course was great! A good introduction to data structures, complexity, sorting algorithms, etc. Very relevant for the future.",
          "The homeworks could do with more clarity of instructions, as could the tests. Perhaps have peer mentors go through them to see if there are any issues in understanding the wording of questions and tasks. Still a good class, and helpful if you are able to pay attention in lectures. It might help to have lectures not be entirely taught off of slides though. Can be easy to get lost.",
          "Great!",
          "Ian does a great job of presenting material that isn't necessarily exciting in an interesting and engaging way. The labs weren't always super interesting, but I at least could feel like they were teaching me how something works and how to build it. Quizzes were generally fair.",
          "Good comprehensive overview",
          "I was expecting much more out of this class - I was really disappointed with the level of disorganization in it seeing as this class is fundamental to any CS curriculum, and I felt that it could be greatly improved by adding clarity to the slides and not focusing on creating code that passes every thinkable edge case.",
          "Good class. Ian is good teacher. Ethan is a good TA. Both are really patient in explaining things. This class is taught in C#, which is nice. Not too much work outside of class. The one problem I had was that I wished we covered big O more and we were able to get better feedback on what tests we missed on the homework. I've heard this section may be harder than the 214 section taught in the fall.",
          "This course was quite good. I was particularly happy with Ian Horswill's clear and interesting style of teaching, which could make even the most boring and tedious analysis of some algorithm's time complexity interesting and understandable. The labs were a great balance between educational and not extremely difficult.",
          "The material covered in this class is not hard but it's a bit hard to get A since this class DOES NOT HAVE A CURVE! You have to get 94+ to get an A which is a bit hard if you bombed one or two assignments and any one of the three quizzes. Also, I heard from a friend who take this class with Ian last year that the homework assignments were much easier last year since in a lot of assignments they only need to write the methods... But in some of this year's homework (the graph one and the Dijkstra one), we have to build the data structure from scratch by ourselves... Overall this class is really useful and take it with Ian if you can.",
          "I went into this course expecting to really enjoy it but the lectures were incredibly dry. The assignments were also impossible if you didn't go into office hours. Even if you went into office hours, though, the TAs would only help you so much and many times they led me to believe my code was right when it wasn't.",
          "Pretty good course with Ian, pretty necessary for tech interviews",
          "The grading system was very slow and very disorganized with many bugs. Often had to get regraded to get the proper grade.",
          "Data structures is an essential class to take if pursuing a CS career, and Ian helps make that prerequisite (mostly) interesting. You've still got some boring stuff like Trees, Graphs, Queues, and Stacks which you ought to be familiar with before taking this class, but there's a whole lot of brand new stuff like Deques, Heaps, RB Trees etc that really pushes the boundaries of what was possible before knowing all of this stuff.",
          "Overall, the assignments were helpful and you could work through the concepts logically.",
          "The course was fun to go through and reveals a lot of applications of data structures in today's context.",
          "This course is interesting (and maybe even fun?) f you put the time into the assignments and learn the logic behind every concept. That will also help you on the exams because they're less about memorization and more about the concepts and applications of them.",
          "Data structure is very important in modern programming techniques",
          "This was, far and away, the most disorganized class I've ever taken at Northwestern. I've heard of a few worse, but highlights of this class included very slow assignment grading-- even when future assignments depended on the success of past assignments!--, mistakes on exams, and missing necessary details from the homework assignments so that you have to comb Piazza every week to find out what you need to include and don't need to include in your code. Probably the most frustrating thing about this class for me, though, was that in review documents and at review sessions (ones not during lecture time), the peer mentors and TA would say \"don't worry about X, it's not on the exam,\" and then X was on the exam. You can avoid this problem by just studying/memorizing the relevant slides for that exam, and not go to review sessions. Altogether though, I think the problems this class had came from possible miscommunication between instructors, and the TA did seem to become more lenient in grading homework assignments later in the quarter (probably to compensate for mistakes?). Also, the TA seemed kind of overworked; not totally sure what the dynamic was between instructors behind the scenes. -Overall, the content of the class was at least interesting, and you're stuck with 214 anyway if you're doing the EECS major/minor. The lecture slides are really good.",
          "This class will not be curved, and homework is graded harshly, not sure how many students can get A in this class. Still, the topic of this course is really important in computer science. The communication between instructor and TA is not very effective. Consider taking this class with the other professor.",
          "This course helps me create a better knowledge framework on data structure. The professor Ian and TAs are very kind, patient and helpful. The homework took some time, but it's really worth it after you finish the practice. Great teacher, great TA, great class!",
          "Basic course but not as in depth as it needed to be for interviews, etc. Grading is sometimes off for homework assignments; I got a 0% multiple times and had to argue to get credit (Ended up getting a 90% and 100% on the assignments I originally got a 0 on). Ian is an amazing teacher though, definitely take it with him.",
          "The course was interesting in all aspects and definitely met my expectations.",
          "Although the assignments took considerable time, they were very interesting and challenging. In the end, I learned the course material very well mainly thanks to these assignments.",
          "Homework assignments are the more fun for this class than for all the other introductory CS classes (211, 213, 212, 111). Course material covered is also pretty interesting.",
          "Overall, pretty good course. Grading might be a bit frustrating with assignments, but you will learn quite a bit about data structure if you do them.",
          "I thought this course was difficult for me personally because I am still improving as a novice programmer. Many of the assignments were very time consuming and difficult, but it made a better programmer because it forced me to cover all the cases I may overlook while writing the most efficient program possible.",
          "This class is actually super easy. Considering data structures is the most important aspect in tech interviews, I would've preferred a much more difficult and in-depth course. I think any student looking to become a software engineer would actually prefer this class to be more difficult, so they don't have to self study as much later. If you're facing difficulties in this class, and you're not willing to put in the effort to succeed, drop computer science.",
          "Was good review",
          "Ian is a great instructor, as anyone in CS probably already knows, and Ethan is a great TA who is willing to help you out as long as you aren't a jerk. The material is covered very well, and C# will make you forget you ever learned C++. The homeworks are harder than you think, but not hard enough to actually be a problem. Overall, solid class.",
          "I really value the knowledge I learned because they are really crucial for future study.",
          "This is the best course in the CS intro sequence. The homework is, dare I say it, enjoyable to complete, and the material is interesting. MAKE SURE TO READ PIAZZA and follow ALL instructions for homeworks. Exams are easy. Take it with Ian.",
          "The lecturing of this class was not great, it was boring to listen to and a lot of the time it just felt like he was reading off of the slides. In addition to that, the homeworks seem to be graded in a strange way which results in some having very low average grades. This definitely was not a great class.",
          "First CS class I felt was relevant and enjoyable so far in the CS major req sequence. Ian is an engaging professor who makes class interesting, while also teaching you a lot. Also the dinosaur suit he wore to class yesterday was 10\u2f10. HW projects aren't terribly difficult. Ian's tests are chill as always.",
          "This course is incredible if you take it with Ian. The amount you learn about data structures and algorithms and fascinating. It's definitely the best course I've taken at Northwestern so far. The slides are very helpful for the homework and it's important that you understand all of the code if you want a good grade so don't be afraid to ask for clarification if you need to. Plus, once you understand the code, you see the brilliance in how it works.",
          "I enjoyed the course overall, I found it very helpful and straightforward.",
          "Its a solid class. Assignments are hard. But exams are easy if you do the assignments",
          "Great class. Good to know. not too hard. Ian and Ethan are both amazing.",
          "One of my favorite classes from northwestern. Ian is an excellent lecturer and so is Ethan Robison.",
          "",
          "The course material is the most interesting I've seen in an EECS class so far (as a Freshman). Lecture is very useful and will be relevant to the quizzes and homework assignments. Discussion sections are attendance based, but I would encourage you to go and actually complete the code. It will be useful for the quizzes and the homeworks.",
          "",
          "Overall a great class, highly recommend taking in the spring with Ian.",
          "Ian is a nice professor and answers questions, but lectures move too fast and not everything in his slides is covered on the tests so it's hard to say what we actually need to know and what we can disregard.",
          "I enjoyed this class a lot, Ian was a great teacher and this course is very manageable as long as you go to all the classes, pay attention in the lectures, and do the homeworks in a decent amount of time. Discussion sessions were very worth going to as they made up a big chunk of your participation grade, and additionally are great if you're confused about something from lecture or if you need help with something before a test",
          "Ian is a great guy, really nice and helpful, but his lectures were..... so boring. I couldn't follow a lot of what he was saying, and he talks really slow so I often tuned out when I should have been paying attention. Also I was very very annoyed by the style of grading in this class. Ethan the TA would run tests on our code and just put in the grades without even really looking at our code. At times, a huge portion of the class would get 0's, and he wouldn't even double-check that something was wrong on his end. We had to email him, often panicking, to get him to fix our grades. I wish instructors would at least pretend to care about the code we spend hours and hours writing before dumping a 0 in the gradebook. It's pretty insulting. A good part of the class was that the tests were fair, and there were a lot of office hours to get help. The homeworks were sometimes unreasonably difficult and time-consuming. Sometimes the code they provided had bugs.",
          "Very interesting topic but classic Ian class, kind of boring lectures after a while. I think the material, given how cool it is, could definitely have been presented in a more exciting way. Overall, not too hard, but you need to memorize quite a bit of material for the exams.",
          "Interesting course, really getting more into the meat of comp sci and how data is organized (thus data structures)",
          "I don't get why we still use C#, it's dumb. But whatever. Btw, if you have a Mac, pay the $40 to get parallels, it's 100% worth it.",
          "For me, this course was the easiest out of the 211-214 sequence. It was very fun and everything you need to know is in the slides. The quizzes are not too hard and they give you the answers as you're walking out of the room afterwards, which I liked a lot. Ian and Ethan were great! I recommend.",
          "I learned a shit ton and it made me a better programmer. Yes, the class is hard, but that's required.",
          "It was tough but taught me a lot.",
          "Ian is a great lecturer and exams are pretty straight forward. Assignments for homework can sometimes take a long time, and don't get graded for a while (it mostly due to TA's though). Overall, very interesting class",
          "I thought the assignments were appropriate, but sometimes could just get tricky with Visual Studio and all its little quirks. C# is a very logical language to use, so I appreciated that, and I liked how this class focused more on concepts than syntax so we could write pseudocode for tests and that was perfectly acceptable. It's good to have someone available to explain things you don't understand - so office hours\u02ffriends are vital!",
          "Very interesting course. Homework assignments were unnecessarily difficult though. Very long and almost near impossible without the help of a TA to guide you.",
          "This class is extremely important because what you learn here is very relevant to technical interviews.",
          "It was an interesting course. Homeworks are not too challenging but you really have to do a lot of testing."

          "It was a pretty good course. It could have been better, but considering that it was professor Hester's first quarter teaching it, it wasn't too bad. Also, TAs help you SOOOO much, so make sure you visit them! Exams are pretty fair, but labs can be pretty confusing.",
          "Pretty low-key course. Lots of in-class times to do labs, which are pretty straightforward. Instructor seemed to change the course content week-by-week. The TA (Curtis Wang) taught the course, and the instructor was just there sometimes, but he didn't really seem like he was that engaged/knowledgeable about questions -- in fact, Curtis was really the professor for the course and Hester was more like the TA. We learned a few things about timing diagrams, address latching, but it was much more a \"do stuff in lab\" course. Seems odd that such a big part of the course grade was exams, when there wasn't that much lecture content.",

          "This course is separated into three distinct sections. For the first section with Taflove, going to office hours are very helpful the lectures were very relevant with the homework. For the second section with Mikhelson, he does a good job keeping an electronic copy of the materials in class and polls the class for understanding. For the last section with Grayson, he really tries to engage the class and tries to make sure everyone is able to understand the material. In addition, watch out for the labs particularly in the first section of the class. While ungraded, the labs try to cover an ambitious amount of material and might not always work.",
          "Professor Taflove teaches the first part of the course and it is fairly difficult, but if you go to his office hours, he walks you through every homework problem. Professor Mikhelson is one of my favorite professors and gives more than enough resources to complete his section (lecture notes, lecture recordings). Professor Grayson taught the last section and was able to keep the course fairly interesting with only an introduction to his section in 2 weeks.",
          "This course is divided into 3 sections so I will talk about what each professor taught in chronological order:",
          "",
          "1. Allen Taflove: lovable guy. He is very passionate about the material and wants you to understand it. The test for his portion is notoriously difficult. Study hard for it and practice all the homework problems in order to destroy the curve. **Note: go to office hours every week for homework.**",
          "",
          "2. Ilya Mikhelson: hands down best teacher I ever had at Northwestern so far. Everyone loves him. Great sense of humor and a really nice guy. He's great at involving the class in discussion, and he's excellent at explaining the material. If you struggle or miss class, he tapes every lecture as well as videos of him explaining concepts and puts them online. His material makes sense and directly matches what gets tested on the final.",

          "3. Matt Grayson: this guy tries to be Mikhelson but is just kind of a jerk. He tries to engage the class but its more uncomfortable than welcoming (you'll see what I mean). His material is boring and some things on the final weren't even covered in class.",

          "Overall: Taflove is cool, Ilya is FANTASTIC, Grayson sucks but still take the class because Grayson only teaches for 3 weeks.",

          "AMAZING COURSE - If you're looking for a general engineering course to take - take this one! I have always been so bad at learning circuits, but it finally clicked after taking this course. The instructors are ALL amazing. Taflove went really slow and took you through every problem step by step so that you truly understood each problem. He took an extra 2+ hours every day for office hours to make sure you understood the homework. Mikhelson has always been known as a great professor for EA1 and he is just as good for this course. Grayson is hilarious and takes the time to get to know the students in the course and makes sure we truly understand the content he's teaching. All tests are open notes, and non-cumulative, so it feels like we took 3 mini courses, which made it much easier to learn and retain information. I thought I would hate this class (because I generally don't like EECS classes), but honestly I haven't learned as much in depth in a course at NU as I have during this one.",
          "This class isn't really introductory, more like intermediate. You should NOT take this for an easy elective. Most of the people dropped it after the midterm because of little curving. Taflove's portion is straight up hell haha. Go to his office hours. His midterm is crazy hard even if you know everything from lectures - I feel like some of the problems you just couldn't solve without having seen them beforehand and it seems like some people cheated (the ones who got near perfect grades but what do I know). Ilya's section is great because he is - he posts everything online even recordings of the lectures which makes learning the material super easy (and yes lectures become pretty optional as long as you watch them online). Grayson is super knowledgeable on his portion of the course and has some pretty cool ways of describing semiconductors. Overall the teaching became better with each professor but was always pretty decent. Learned a TON and that is why this course probably shouldn't be called just an introductory course. The labs especially are super challenging and 3 hours long but everyone pretty much gets 100s automatically.",
          "I only took this class because I had to. I did not enjoy it but it was well done.",
          "Poorly organized course with irrelevant, tedious labs. The cutoff for passing is very low, but the cutoff for getting an A is very high. The only interesting portion of the course is taught by Ilya.",
          "This class was a massive waste of time. The labs took too long, and most lectures did not stimulate my interest at all. Furthermore, as a class that fulfills a Basic Engineering requirement, I did not take away any engineering skills or knowledge.",

Grading on exams seemed to be pretty harsh, but you should be okay if you are up-to-date with the class material.",
          "Kumar is really the guy for this. However, his teaching degrades significantly starting with complex frequency stuff, so make sure to stay on top of things while you're nearing the end of the course. Midterms are decent. Final is ridiculously and unnecessarily difficult. Be careful. Also, Mike is an amazing TA. Know his value.",
          "Alot of useful content, Prem is a good professor, the labs are relatively tedious but doable, and overall grading is fair. Take this class as a more in depth look at the circuits content in 202.",
          "I feel like I learned, but the exams were pretty challenging.",
          "The class was difficult and the homework and labs together were very time-consuming, although the material in class was taught as well as possible I believe, although the whole class is based off solving circuits by hand which is pretty irrelevant in practice considering todays technologies",
          "Awesome course. DO take it with professor Kumar. He is great, and he has tremendous amount of knowledge in regarding electrical\u02fcomputer engineering. Tests can be a bit tough, but I think they are pretty fair in terms of materials. It can be just a bit confusing from confronting weird looking circuits and some twists.",
          "This course is too fast and difficult for 10 weeks. It's a core class and I was excited about the EE major but I think I'm about to change me major because the exams were much harder than the homeworks, which should not be the case. Needs to be taught better or tested fairer. Maybe cut down on the material at the end to make sure you teach the fundamentals well. Northwestern needs to consider how it teaches EE courses if it wants to sustain undergraduate interest.",
          "difficult and detail driven work, but hey, it does teach you the basics. just pay attention and for GOD'S sakes check your answers SOMEHOW lol.",
          "I would have learned much more if it weren't for the professor's trying to cram way too much material into the quarter; Professor Kumar is an expert in the field and knows the material very well. However, he didn't give each topic proper time for us to fully understand it. The exams are difficult, and he is very harsh with the grading. The class is also curved to a B- not a B. The second midterm, in specific, was very time intensive.",
          "Take this course with Prof. Kumar, he is great. Very organized and experienced instructor who is passionate about the subject. The labs are rather painful and are in bad need of a refresh. Exams were very fair EXCEPT for the final, which was not at all consistent with the difficulty of the homework or the midterm. Kumar put some tricky twists that were completely unnecessary, and graded the midterms rather harshly (i.e. 3% off final grade for a simple flipped sign). Might be a good idea to take 222 before this, as the Laplace transform is essential to 1\u02f3 of the material, yet is purposefully omitted from this course, making the content more tricky than necessary. EA4 is 100% a prerequisite for this, but wasn't listed as one on the course website."

Also a good blend of text, films, and productions so you get a really well-rounded exposure to Shakespeare. Lectures were always incredibly engaging and made me think about the plays differently. Professor Phillips really cares about her students, too, which made the experience really enjoyable. Overall a great class, would highly recommend!",

          "The class is a fair amount of work, as you have 2 papers, a mid-term exam, and final exam, as well as in-class performances and you have to be regular with the reading. The extra-credit work for the pop-culture challenge also adds a time- commitment element to the class, so it adds up.",
          "GREAT COURSE! I love shakespeare, and prof Phillips is a fantastic lecturer. She presents the material in an intteresting, engaging way, and the papers/midterm aren't very tough.",
          "This course was AMAZING. Prof. Phillips was amazing and I can't imagine taking this course without her. Her lectures were always interesting but it was important that you did the reading. Honestly this class is a lot of work and if you don't enjoy the subject or the teaching style of Prof. Phillips, then this class isn't for you. But if you do take it, know that she's amazing and the TAs are there to help you out! There are 2 papers, a midterm and a final.",
          "I had very little interest in taking this course, and ended up taking it because of a scheduling conflict. That said, I am so glad that I ended up in this class because I have learned so much and had a lot of fun. Professor Phillips is a master of making a 100+ person lecture feel like a discussion, and the TAs are brilliant. As someone who only read Shakespeare in high school, I wasn't very enthusiastic about reading Shakespeare, but Professor Phillips changed my whole outlook on the matter. This is a great class for English majors, theatre majors, or anyone who wants to become a better close reader.",
          "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN EASY DISTRO. I took this class having flown through AP and honors English classes in high school with a strong Shakespeare background. This class is by no means an easy A whatsoever or even remotely close. This class is dominated by theatre and journalism majors who really have a burning passion for Shakespeare and the professor and TA pick favorites very quickly. The TA constantly had nonsensical comments on papers (i.e. this paper is too thesis driven) then assigned subpar grades with little explanation. Papers are also fairly long (4-6 pages, 2 total). Pop quizzes are given to ensure attendance but often include extremely difficult and ambiguous questions. Exams include identifying fairly ambiguous quotes and explaining their relevance. If you explain a theme different than the theme intended, you are penalized severely. Professor Phillips is extremely passionate about the subject, but my TA was pretentious and would offer little to no help in office hours. This was the worst and most difficult class I took this quarter, and I also took intensive abstract linear algebra. TERRIBLE CLASS DO NOT TAKE.",
          "This was a great course for developing critical thinking and analyzing text. I learned a lot and Professor Phillips was great. However it was a lot of reading, about a play a week so it will take a lot of time, especially if you want to read the plays closely.",
          "This course is good for people who are very interested in English, however I would not recommend it as a distro because there is a lot of reading and it was at times difficult to keep up with. It was extremely helpful to learn about close reading and analyzing text, especially considering our essays were normally focused on a very small part of a particular play.",
          "I enjoyed the plays we read, the movies we watched, and Professor Phillip's analysis on the plays. The discussions we had in lecture were interesting, but sometimes relied too much on student participation when I wish I got to hear more from Professor Phillips.",
          "This course was a pretty good one. It was interesting and Professor Phillips is very engaging and exciting. It was just A LOT to handle, as we had to read 7 of Shakespeare's plays over the whole quarter--which is a lot, especially in the tiny-font Norton book. The plays were fun to read, though, and it was interesting to hear others' perspectives. I just think it might be better if we could read even one less play, to have more time to understand it and go a lot more in-depth.",
          "This was a truly unbelievable class. Professor Phillips is one of the most amazing lecturers I have ever had, and I could not recommend this class more highly. However, this is certainly not an easy and light work 200 level English class, so be prepared to work hard! If you like Shakespeare at all, you will LOVE this class.",
          "Professor Phillips is an absolutely incredible professor and this class was phenomenal. Very few professors make the effort to get to know their students like she does, and the class, despite being tremendously quickly paced, was an absolutely amazing time and helped me learn a ton about Shakespeare and his works. I feel like I know significantly more coming out of this class than I did going in, and I'm very tremendously happy that I took it and would recommend it to any student who is even remotely interested in Shakespeare. Again, this class moves tremendously quickly, and I would not take it with an already busy schedule, but I took it as a distribution requirement and it was by far my favorite course of the quarter.",
          "This class was a lot of work (obviously because we basically read a play a week) but in ways that I wasn't expecting too. There's a graded scene performance and the midterm\u02ffinal are ridiculous in the amount of writing they expect you to do in an hour and a half (and then they're graded harshly with no explanation as to what you did wrong). It's all way too much for a 200-level distro, and even though I liked the professor and my TA, it wasn't worth it. Don't take it unless you're a theater major who writes well and talks all the time; these people were like half the class and completely dominated lecture and discussion, so I assume they're doing well in the class.",
          "It was really fun. We got to act out scenes from different plays, and form arguments from the text. It was a great intellectually stimulating class.",
          "Very engaging and interesting way of teaching Shakespeare",
          "This class was great but not easy. It is certainly not an easy A, there are 2 essays, a midterm, and a final, and each of them are graded very harshly - maybe too harshly for an introductory course. That being said, Professor Phillips is a great teacher and really makes Shakespeare very interesting to discuss. She is adept at teaching a large group of student yet making it feel like a smaller discussion-based class. Nina was a great TA and super helpful - I would take this class if you are at all interested in Shakespeare or english classes.",
          "This is a fantastic course. Professor Phillips is an incredibly engaging, incisive, funny lecturer who gets right to the heart of each of the plays. She has very high standards and I felt pushed to put out my best work all quarter, but the classroom had a very inspiring, non-oppressive feel to it. I felt like I really grew as a reader of Shakespeare and an analytical writer this quarter. Also, I had already read four of the seven plays in high school, but Phillips examines them much more rigorously than my high school teachers ever did, so I was by no means bored. I highly, highly recommend!",
          "It was a lot of work, but forcing yourself to read all the plays and deeply analyze what is being said is a very important skill and I definitely improved in that regard.",
          "Heavy reading. Read one play a week, for the most part. Two papers and a midterm and final. There were about three pop quizzes in lecture. Overall, highly recommend the course. Was my most interesting and engaging course of the quarter. Dont think there could be a professor more thoughtful, detailed, and caring than Professor Phillips that could teach this course. Definitely not an easy course, but completely worth the time and effort.",
          "I would recommend this course to anyone. Professor Phillips in such an intelligent, informed professor who makes lectures incredibly engaging. Because we read and discussed so much Shakespeare in the quarter, I quickly became so much more comfortable with the material so each consecutive play became easier to understand and analyze. This class is a lot of reading, however. We had to read a full Shakepeare play almost every week so even though I absolutely loved the class, you have to be prepared for that much Shakespeare reading every week.",
          "This course was excellent! Professor Phillips is a passionate and inspired teacher, and there was always something new and exciting to talk about in lecture. The TAs were fantastic, and I really got a lot out of discussion sections.",
          "As someone who loathes Shakespeare, I found myself pleasantly surprised at this course. I was dreading it, especially after getting a C in high school Shakespeare, but this course totally changed how I look at Shakespeare. Readings can be tedious and the midterm\u02fexam is difficult, but you can easily prepare for it by taking good notes during lecture and re-reading the plays before exams.",
          "I\u027d say it's a good freshman \"intro to college class,\" but I didn't find it very valuable as an upperclassman. The exams are about regurgitating the themes that the professor presents in class rather than presenting your own analyses, and there is a lot of memorization required that I do not find valuable. Was excited to take this course because I love Shakespeare, but I was left disillusioned.",
          "The reading is manageable but the course content is very difficult and the workload is high. The pop quizzes aren't too bad, but the essays are fairly involved (6ish pages of close analysis), and there is a section performance that is a very very difficult assignment if you're not used to memorizing and performing plays (I had to memorize about 50 lines). The midterm exam is difficult but manageable if you just read the plays, and they can't be easily bypassed by reading summaries. In addition to the pop quizzes, midterm, and first essay, there is both a final essay and a final exam, which really feels like way too much work for a distro. A lot of students in the class were theater kids and really seemed to enjoy it, but it's not that way if you have very little interest in Shakespeare. I had trouble keeping up with the lectures, but that's really mostly because I was uninterested in the subject. But I think Suzy is a good lecturer, and she has enthusiasm for the subject, so I can see why students who like the subject would enjoy the lectures. To recap, this class has three pop quizzes, two essays, two exams, and a performance. None of these assignments is easy. I would not recommend this class unless you have a strong interest in theater or Shakespeare, and I would not recommend it to people in STEM who are doing this for the distro. There are much easier distros out there. One final thing: the class is very geared toward freshmen, and the vast majority of students are freshmen.",
          "This course is extremely well taught. Both the professor and the TAs are unbelievably passionate and knowledgeable. Every class is a combination of lecture, discussion, close reading, performances, film viewings, trivia and more, which always keeps it exciting. Expectations are high, but the material and its presentation are exemplary.",
          "Definitely more time consuming than some other English classes. Professor Phillips is a great professor though and if you keep up with the reading (unlike me) you'll be fine",
          "I absolutely loved this class, it was a lot of work, but none of it was busywork, Phillips and the TAs really want to make sure you learn as much as you can and are very passionate about the topics.",
          "Kinda annoying course, although professor genuinely cares.",
          "Professor Phillips is incredibly knowledgeable and so engaging. She is possibly one of the best professors I've had here so far. Shakespeare really scared me at the beginning of this quarter and her class made the material feel so much more accessible and exciting to discuss. She truly teaches the class in a way that shows how much she cares about students learning and your grade will truly affect the work you've put in. It's by no means easy, but if you show up to lecture and read the plays, you will gain so much from this course and feel challenged as well as supported!!",
          "Professor Phillips is the nicest human being. Taking a class with her is a must.",
          "We covered plays in different mediums, through live performance, reading, and media, which I think is important for grasping how the Bard's work can be interpreted. Overall the course is great, covering so much in so short a time that it's impossible to feel like you haven't learned anything.",
          "The course was interesting, but the requirements of watching a movie and reading a play every week take more time than expected.",
          "This course is really interesting, but requires a lot of out of class time because of all the reading. You read one play per week, and because of the nature of the exams, you really have to read the real plays.",
          "Not an intro course. Extensive reading every single week and pop quizzes. TA also was extremely unhelpful. Exams were a poor measure of what we learned",
          "This is a really worthwhile class. Phillips has a passion for Shakespeare, and it comes through in her fascinating and thought-provoking lectures. Grading isn't incredibly easy, but Phillips and her TAs clearly want students to succeed. The course isn't a huge time investment, and it's fairly easy to do well if one reads the plays by the time one is supposed to. Definitely a great class to take for prospective majors or otherwise.",
          "It was an interesting class to fill a distro without being burdensome",
          "Professor Phillips is one of the most brilliant teachers I have ever encountered. The way she engages with her students on not only an intellectual but a personal level is incredible. She knew every one of the 100ish students' names by the end of the first week. She took the passion I already harbored for Shakespeare and his works and amplified it by introducing whole new ways of thinking about texts I may already have read. I cannot stress enough that everyone even remotely interested in Shakespeare should undoubtedly and immediately try to fit it into their schedule next fall. One of a kind.",
          "The class was fine. Although, if I could go back, I would not take it. I did not like the lecturing style of Prof. Phillips. It constantly felt as if we were in a high school lecture. It was a huge lecture, yet most of class was spent as if it were a discussion. It became hard to follow, and tiresome.",
          "Everything Susie Phillips says is enlightening.",
          "I loved this class. I improved my argumentative writing and close reading skills. In addition, I got to learn a lot about Shakespeare's works in a very engaging setting! You get the grades you deserve in this class. You get out of this class what you put into it. Solid class overall.",
          "I thought the course was overall interesting and enjoyable. You have to read a lot of plays, but the pacing of the course made it bearable, and there were opportunities to catch up. Overall the papers were interesting and the tests fair.",
          "It is jam packed with theatre majors, so the curve is not that good. As a comms major, it was sometimes overwhelming because the theatre kids always try to be above and beyond during lecture, so be prepared for that. You only write 2 major papers, which is not bad at all as long as you do the readings. The mid terms and finals are hard in that you really have to close read each of the texts and actually watch the movies on your own time.",
          "As a junior, it can be easy to feel jaded in big lectures, but this was honestly one of my favorite courses I have taken at NU. I really have a new appreciation for Shakespeare's plays, and Phillips is so so smart, caring and an overall awesome professor! Take this class!",
          "This course pushed my analysis and required that I become a more focused writer. Much of the readings were readings of Shakespeare's Plays with little extraneous material, which made the outside reading requirement relatively low. Both Professor Phillips and my TA were extremely helpful and presented interesting interpretations of the plays.",
          "I loved the plays and enjoyed listening to her analysis, but the exams and papers were incredibly difficult and we were not prepared for them. The midterms had no review material or study guides, yet had incredibly specific rubrics and were largely based on memorization or details not emphasized in class.",
          "Professor Philips is SO FANTASTIC! This was by far the best class I took this quarter, and probably one of the best I'll ever take. Her lectures encouraged me to think about the plays and to participate in class (she remembered everyone's names after week 2), and hugely added to my reading and interpretation of the plays. When you learn Shakespeare, you learn about all of literature, and as the weeks went by, I really came to a much deeper understanding of the themes and writing of his plays. Professor Phillips is incredibly charismatic, and manages to inspire students by making the themes of 400 year old plays freshly original and relevant to our time. This is definitely a hard class, with tons of reading and writing (especially in exams), but I was very motivated by the lectures to improve over the course. Don't take this if you're swamped with all of your other classes (do it right) of if you're not interested in Shakespeare and the process of reading and analyzing it, but this is an absolutely amazing lecture and is very rewarding. SO GOOD!",
          "At the beginning of the course, I was definitely bogged down by the reading. I was trying to understand every little thing about every play, which slowed me down significantly. But, once I got a feel for what the professor was looking for, I began to enjoy the course a lot more. Professor Phillips's theses in class caught me as very surprising and were fun to follow along or argue against. And although I felt a bit too nervous to speak up in lecture, discussion sections eased that tension quite a bit. My least favorite part was probably the movies; I fell asleep most of the time and my interest in Shakespeare waned because of them.",
          "This class helped develop my love and passion for reading, writing about, and above all, studying Shakespeare.",
          "This course was incredibly well-constructed and informative. Professor Phillips challenged us intellectually, while making sure that her lessons were clear and understandable. It is a large class, but she made the class environment feel small/intimate as she constantly was encouraging students to participate/speak up and contribute to her lectures. She also remembers everyone's names, which just goes to show her amazing attention to detail, and the genuine care she has for her students. She is incredibly fair regarding the difficulty of tests/homework, and grading. Incredibly fair.",
          "I had a great time. Even though it was an early class it was fun to be in as Professor Phillips lectures were always engaging. She lead the class in examining the text in new ways so that even if you had read them before, you saw a new perspective. I wish there were more graded opportunities because there were only two papers to demonstrate your growth. The reading seems like a lot at first but as the course continues you tend to get faster, and your reading more close just based on the example set by the lectures. The mid term and exam were both fair assessments of course knowledge.",
          "The professor was fantastic! Her takes on Shakespeare and her ability to deliver it clearly and entertainingly in lecture made this class amazing. The TAs were also particularly good (a/o to Harris) and helped a lot.",
          "This is the BEST class at Northwestern, Susan Phillips is a magical woman and truly changed/grew me as a learner and shakespeare-lover. This class completely cracked open Shakespeare and made it accessible to me, which I really appreciated especially as a theater major. The discussions and lectures were crazy compelling and interesting. By about the third class Susan Phillips knew every students name in the lecture... which was about 100 kids. It was remarkable to feel how invested she was in the class and in the students and in the material. It was fun, and interesting, and fair. (Tests were hard but if you showed up and read the material they were very fair). Good stuff!",
          "I absolutely loved this course, and have never learned more about Shakespeare or his work than I did this quarter. The professor is phenomenal, and her TA's were all top-notch. For some, reading Shakespeare might be a chore, but in this class you learn to read it much like its own language and it is so much fun. Highly recommended.",
          "This class and its CTECs LIE. No one told me before taking this class how much I would regret taking it in the first place. If you are not a theater major avoid at all costs. She speaks to the class like they are freshmen in high school, and grades like they're English majors. You have to study 7 plays and get tested on random passages with no context. You write an in-class essay for the final after you already turned in a final paper. There were several classes where I left frustrated knowing I didn't have to be there at all. Take if you love raising your hand and talking for 5 minutes about Othello in front of a 150 person lecture!"

          "This course is incredible. Everyone should take it. Professor Phillips is brilliant and brings the course material to life.",
          "This is very much a class geared towards freshmen, so it was somewhat awkward taking this class as a senior for a distribution. Professor Phillips is a good lecturer, and the course looked at several works from new angles that I had not anticipated. The pacing of the course is fairly quick, and there are (unfortunately) pop quizzes, so it's important to stay on top of the readings. That said, the time requirements are not too bad, so it's a good course for a distribution requirement.",
          "This is definitely not an easy class and I am not expecting excellent grades but I still think taking this class was a right thing to do! Professor Phillips is truly the best professor ever both academic-wise and personality-wise!",
          "I loved this class; Professor Phillips is wonderful and each lecture was more interesting than the last. There is quite a bit of reading and the exams are challenging, as they involve a great deal of writing within a small timeframe.",
          "The professor is incredibly engaging and the course is great all around. Also great TAs",
          "I'm a math major and I enjoyed this course a lot. It was a distro for me, and I've had some Shakespeare experience, but that doesn't mean it was extremely easy. I was still challenged at times but it was worth it. Prof Philips is a great, great teacher; she gave so much info about the plays that helped for quizzes and papers and the midterm. She also kept it lively, not just boring lecture. There were a few reading quizzes (pretty simple), a midterm which was short answers, two papers not too long, and a final which was short answer and an essay question. Overall, the material was doable. I found sections to be good too. If you have any interest, consider taking it with Philips for sure!",
          "This is an amazing course. Intro to Shakes will make you a better reader, writer, and person, and the professor, Susie Phillips, is amazing.",
          "I loved this class! Prof. Susie Phillips is a dream. She preps like a whole essay worth of material for each class and hits that perfect balance between lecture and discussion (especially for a class this big)! It is a totally manageable amount of work and the number of plays we had to read was honestly way better than I thought it would be. There were a crazy amount of theater kids but I totally still knew people in the class! Def take this class",
          "It's difficult, especially with the reading and trying to keep one play straight from the other because some of the questions are applicable with a lot of plays which makes her quizzes and exams challenging. But it's a good challenge and pushed me to study and develop better habits as a student. DON'T TAKE IT if you don't pay attention to detail or like diving deep into texts and their historical significance. This is not the course for you",
          "Prof. Phillips is probably the best professor I had at Northwestern. She for sure made me a better writer, thinker, and she takes time to get to know all her students, even in a large class. Lots of work for the class, as there are papers, tests, and section, but it is worth it. Also, Matt Beeber is an amazing TA.",
          "The pace was a bit rough, and I was never 100% certain what acts and scenes she wanted us to read by what class--it averaged out to a play a week. Stay on top of the reading because there is a lot! She does give pop quizzes, but they're relatively straight forward (though sometimes if you weren't sure if you were supposed to read the whole play or just the first 3 acts, you could lose points on a quiz when it tested over the whole thing). A lot of information is thrown at you, but it is super interesting. The professor is engaging and understanding-very easy to talk to. There's not much time for the midterm or final, so write fast. Overall a great class that really digs into the text and makes you think.",
          "This class was awesome! There was a lot of reading. 2 exams and 2 papers mainly. If you are bad at keeping up on reading this may not be the best.",
          "Professor Phillips is incredibly passionate. It can be difficult to keep up at times, but the challenge pays off.",
          "Prof. Phillips is one of the greatest people I have ever met. Even if you don't like Shakespeare, take this class to get to know her and learn about life.",
          "Take this class with Susie Phillips! She is a fantastic professor and very knowledgeable about everything. This class will challenge you to closely analyze Shakespeare's texts, you will be pushed in that aspect, but a very fun and helpful English distro. ALSO TA Matt Beeber is the best, take any class that he is TAing.",
          "This class is a lot of reading, but it's never boring. Susie Phillips is WONDERFUL. Her lectures were so engaging, and she made an effort to connect with every student, despite the large class size. Take this class!",
          "Class was always super interesting. Professor Philips is amazing and brought so much energy to class every morning. You can tell she really cares about her students and class content. She also brings candy to class all the time.",
          "Take this class even if you have the slightest interest in Shakespeare! Professor Phillips is genuinely a captivating and interesting lecturer and all the TA's are wonderful. It is fast paced though, so make sure to keep up with the play readings. 10\u2f10 recommend, as this is the best class I've taken at Northwestern so far. I met close friends due to how interactive the class is, and the discussion sections were stimulating but also really enjoyable. Prof. Phillips also knew all our names by the 3rd class!",
          "I really liked the teacher's ability to address the student's thoughts but also to challenge us to point to the text and to think of the why.",
          "Professor Phillips is AMAZING. She might be the best professor I've had at Northwestern so far. The lectures are all extremely engaging, the readings are obviously interesting given that they're all Shakespeare plays and the TAs were all great. I would 100% recommend this course to anyone.",
          "I love this course. It is certainly not easy, but Professor Phillips made me look forward to coming to class everyday which is the most important part of teaching.",
          "Take this course for SUZIE. She is unbelievable and I've learned so much from her.",
          "Really, really interesting class. Professor Phillips is engaging, caring, and easily the smartest woman I've ever met. She makes an effort, even though it's a large class, to get to know a majority of her students. I would take any class she taught. 11\u2f10 recommend.",
          "As a theater minor, I wanted to learn more about literature and how it relates to performance, which this course actually does a lot of, but not too much (so if you are not into performing, that doesn't matter, it's still a great course). I learned more about how to analyze texts, and even more about what Shakespeare was trying to say with his writing, and even things that he may have no intended, but now in modern times we recognize and interpret. It gave me a whole new perspective on Shakespeare's work.",
          "My main reason for taking this class was that I wanted to read more Shakespeare, and I definitely did that! We read 7 plays throughout the year that I really enjoyed and and had really interesting classroom discussions about all of them. However, I thought the midterm and final were WAY to long, for even though I knew all of the information, I still couldn't finish in time. Still a good class to take!",
          "This course was a lot of work, but was also an enjoyable class. Lots of different components - papers, tests, performances, discussion, readings - but if you went to class and read the plays you could do fine. Great professor and TAs.",
          "Great class, definitely more work than your average 200 distro, but definitely worth it. Phillips is a very engaging lecturer, and you definitely come out of this class with more appreciation for the material.",
          "One of the most important aspects of this class that I noticed is how important it is to Professor Phillips that everyone does well on papers and the mid-term. She truly does care about each and every one of her students and reaches out to anyone who is in need of help. The lecture sometimes was a little tedious to get through since you just go through quotes about the play you are reading, but the arguments that are made by Professor Phillips in these lectures do elucidate a key characteristic of the play. The papers are oddly enjoyable. The quizzes suck, but they are not that important in the final grade so that makes up for it. The discussion sections were awesome. My TA was fun and really got us to think about the play in a different way than i had ever thought about Shakespearean plays. Cameron helped us out with anything that we needed and he read my thesis on my final paper to see if i had a strong argument, which really helped me a lot. In short, this class was spectacular because of the importance that the professor and Teacher's Assistant gives to every student, even though the material was not that exciting.",
          "Awesome class. Professor Phillips is DOPE and so is Delali. It's a LOT of reading, but it's worth it in my opinion.",
          "Professor Phillips is awesome. She's a fantastic lecturer and if you're interested in English, you need to take a class with her before you leave. The readings can be long but it isn't too brutal, and it's easy to play to catch up if you have to. Definitely take this class if you want a cool English elective.",
          "This course is fantastic if you want a nice introduction to Shakespeare with a fantastic teacher and great TAs. No previous knowledge is required, and a lot will be gained throughout the course. Grading is fair, and homework is fairly light, though there is a good amount of reading required. The midterm was very fair, and the class really helps you practice your critical thinking skills. Not to mention Susie Phillips is just a fantastic, intelligent, and very emotionally invested teacher who really just wants you to learn and become a better person. A great use of your quarter.",
          "I am so happy to have taken this class because I think it really challenged my analytical skills. Since I am a freshman, I am now interested in possibly pursuing an English major because of Intro to Shakespeare.",
          "Professor Philips has a great way of making something that could be dry in the hands of another professor vastly intriguing. The class is very fair: if you read the plays, you will do well. The papers, while challenging, were never a burden. My biggest complaint would be the time constraint the midterm and final exams put you under: there simply was not enough time for majority of the class to finish their midterms.",
          "I was a fan of the in-class discussions and thought they were an insightful companion to the texts. However, as I am not a skilled writer, I found the writing sections very stressful.",
          "A great range of Shakespeare's plays in one quarter and Prof. Phillips is an amazing lecturer. However, between the readings, watching the film versions, 2 papers, and exams, I found that the course took much more of my time than I expected."

          "Prof. Schwartz is extremely knowledgable about Paradise Lost and all of Milton's writings. Most of the class consisted of her going over all the readings, which was really helpful because Paradise Lost is incredibly dense. Overall workload wasn't too bad either, 3-page midterm paper, 8-10 final paper and a presentation during the quarter. The whole class had a very laid back feel, which wasn't what I expected going into a class about John Milton.",
          "1 midterm paper (3 pages), 1 final paper (8-10pg), 1 oral report. Not too much work, which left a lot of time to focus on the text.",
          "What you takeaway from the course is proportional to the effort you put in. Schwartz is an expert in Milton and really helps to unpack the density of Paradise Lost. Whereas I derived a lot of value from the theological explanations of MIlton's perspective, I can't say I improved a ton as a student.",
          "If you are in any way interested in reading Paradise Lost, take this class with Prof. Schwartz. She is insanely knowledgeable of Milton and his works, and also quite nice, and as a result, I found this class to be very rewarding.",
          "Reading paradise lost and understanding it and it's significance.",
          "Prof. Schwartz clearly knows a ton about Milton and has endless insights into Paradise Lost. I was a little annoyed at how often class got derailed by tangential discussions that had little to do with the text. I wish I heard more from Schwartz in class.",
          "Prof. Schwartz is super knowledgable about Milton, and she does a great job of helping you understand it. Not very many assignments other than the reading.",
          "Prof. Schwartz is very knowledgeable about Milton, but I found the class to be a bit dull. The reading schedule was uneven, starting with one book a week, but by midterm season, we had two books of Paradise Lost per week and were getting behind. Ultimately, we had some great theological discussions, but I think Schwartz is a little too close to the material for apt criticism of the work.",
          "Not too much work but very interesting class. I had no idea who Milton was prior to taking this class and he\u2019s actually a super cool dude. Paradise lost was a very dense read, but the professor was super good at explaining what was important to the understanding of the book.",
          "While paradise lost is an amazing book, I did not feel that the instructor taught it in an effective way that made her students want to learn. whenever we expressed our opinions she told us they were wrong if they were not what she believed to be Milton's interpretation, and left no room for opinion.",
          "Great class if you're interested in John Milton or Renaissance literature, everything is well explained and the assignments are straightforward and not too difficult or too easy",
          "Great course, highly recommend. Grading system was fair with 2 papers and a presentation.",
          "A really wonderful class for discussing religion and the ideas presented in the Bible, but not so great if you're looking to engage with Milton's words on a literary level. A lot of the class is just listening to the professor translate that week's reading to you and then some really engaging discussion about the ideas presented in Christian ideology. Not a bad class, but definitely not what I expected.",
          "This was a good course, Paradise Lost was super interesting and the prof was really good at making us understand what was going on. She really knew the book and Milton. I wish it was a little more participation based as a lot of classes are just her talking about the chapters we had to read, which wasn't really that bad since it really helped me understand the book.",
          "Prof. Schwartz is very enthusiastic about teaching this class, but it didn't go as in-depth into literary analysis as I was hoping."

Half the time I left class, I didn't have homework. Plus, Prof Schwartz is very passionate about Milton. Even if you have no understanding of the Bible or Genesis, she makes the work approachable. If you need a 300 level pre-1830 English class, take this one. It's pretty painless.",

There were so many moments when I read something and was just in awe of how Milton could write so perfectly. My only complaint is that you don't get letter grades on your assignments, so you won't know how you're performing until final grades come out.",

          "This class was my favorite class this quarter! I always looked forward to coming to discussions and sharing my thoughts about the readings. My favorite part was of course the writing itself, though. Professor Donohue is so inspirational and she really lets you use your creativity and write your ideas in whatever way you\u027d like while still assigning structured writing and restrictions for each assignment. Professor Donohue is a great mentor\u2013\u2013she is so sweet and always open to answering questions or even just to talk, and her comments and feedback on my writing were extensive and very helpful in focusing my future drafts and revisions. Also, the final short story workshopping experience was really special and a wonderful experience\u2013\u2013I loved reading everyone's story and, surprisingly, having my own story workshopped. It was really cool to hear what others thought about your writing while also offering your own opinions and comments about other people's writing. The workshopping experience really helped me focus my editing not only on grammar and flow, but also on the structure of the writing and how the writer could better illustrate something in their writing. The course also wasn't extremely time consuming, with 2 poem assignments, one personal narrative, and one short story assignment (and then a final revision of one of your previous writing assignments). Overall, I highly recommend this dynamic and engaging course to anyone who is interested in creative writing, or even if you just really enjoy writing poetry, creative non-fiction, and/or fiction.",
          "The class taught me some of the basics of writing. The frequent workshops provided a lot of support for my writing.",
          "Sheila is a great professor, but I think the quality of this class really depends on the other students in the class. There were 15-16 students in this class, and most of them were pretty chill, but we did have some \"harkness warriors\" which are people who like to dominate the conversation. The plus side of having a small class is that you get very comfortable with everyone. I also really like that we got to workshop our poems and essays. I feel like workshopping\u2fbeing workshopped improved my skills as a writer.",
          "The class was a great balance of reading & writing. I really enjoyed it.",
          "If you are at all interested in creative writing, I highly recommend this course. Sheila Donohue is incredibly engaging and insightful. She's excellent both at leading discussions and at providing helpful, insightful criticism. The class is structured so that with each genre, we first read and discuss published work, then write our own pieces. I found this a very helpful way to learn how to write each genre because it drew my attention to the kinds of artistic decisions I could make when writing. Easily one of my favorite classes thus far!",
          "Amazing class - a great easing in to creative writing for those who are out of practice or those who haven't done so much creative writing in the past. The assignments are interesting and the texts read in class are useful, but the best part of the class is definitely working with a community of writers and your teacher to produce and edit pieces.",
          "This class was awesome, covered enough different kinds of writing to have a variety but also few enough that we went in depth in each one. Was a great experience.",
          "Very good course to take as an elective.",
          "This is a super awesome class and the best academic decision I made freshman fall quarter. Its small environment and ample chances to write poetry, creative essays, and short stories are something really unique for a freshman class, where most other writing based classes will ask you to write analytical essays. The chance to explore all three genres of writing was really awesome as I never really got the chance to do so during high school. Donohue is an awesome professor who is great at getting the class to bond together and improve each others' writing. I had so much fun in this class and it made me start thinking about minoring in creative writing down the road. If you can get in - you need an early registration time because it does fill fast - don't hesitate and take this class.",
          "So much fun!! The class really bonded and Sheila was amazing at guiding conversation and leading us towards accurate analysis.",
          "I learned about the genres and workings of creative writing, my own strengths and weaknesses as a writer, and myself. I'm a big fan."

          "While I really enjoyed the reading and writing assignments for the class, the dynamic of class discussions was very unbalanced, where one student would talk most of the time, and so I feel as though I didn't get much out of the opportunity to learn from other people. It was really frustrating.",
          "Not what I expected, but the final submission showed me that I grew as a writer. It began boring but gradually got much better. Worth taking.",
          "Definitely take this class if you're interested in creative writing and already have experience writing it. However, the course is more focused on discussion of literary techniques based off of literary texts to give a taste of poetry, prose fiction, and creative nonfiction. There is writing and some workshopping, but the class does not hold your hand and teach you the techniques of writing. You just write. In a way, the class is preparing you for the rigor and mindset of future creative writing classes and getting you into the act of writing, point blank. It's not about being a good writer in this course; it's about improving in writing compared to the beginning and the end of the course. However, if you have had no experience prior to creative writing, you may feel like you're hitting the ground running since despite being an \"intro\" class, the course expects you to write poems, short stories, and a creative nonfiction essay after reading and discussing only a few examples and then to be, at the stage of draft #1, ready to share and workshop with others.",
          "This course is an excellent introduction into creative writing and is both fun and thought provoking. If you have a chance to take this class, take it!",
          "I wish that the course could have explored writing more poetry and maybe writing more short passages instead of reading as much.",
          "I found the readings enjoyable and class discussions of them valuable, and the experience of sharing my writing with Professor Curdy and the other students during group critiques provided me with a valuable space to improve. All in all, I'm sure that this was the best English course I could have taken in my first quarter at Northwestern.",
          "The most relevant reaction of mine to this course is that my writing didn't feel rewarded at all.",
          "The pieces we read were so great and good examples to go off of for our own writing. Professor Curdy is very helpful and available to meet with you out of class to talk about how to improve your writing. Great course!!!!!!!",
          "I enjoyed the pieces and how the class worked together to analyze the texts. It was not very encouraging to those who were not as experienced or confident as others.",
          "My main goal going into this course was to improve my revision skills as well as to refine my writing skills overall. This course did both of those things for me and more. It really helped me to figure out that my interest in creative writing went deeper than I thought. Professor Curdy's criticism is only ever constructive and she shares so much with her students."

          "It's a great class for you to look critically at your own work and have the time and space to improve you writing. You also learn how to analyze work as well.",
          "I had not really done any creative writing in high school, so this class was definitely a challenge, but definitely my favorite class so far at NU. The class gets very close because of the subject matter, Prof. Donohue is fantastic, and the structure of the class allows us to really give thought to our piece in all of its stages.",
          "Professor Donohue starts out the course by going over different aspects of genre and writing in general which provides a framework for how we understand the rest of the readings and discussions for the quarter. She is incredibly insightful and has a vast knowledge of literature and poetry. Whenever I would be excited about a piece we read in class, she was always willing to give me suggestions of other readings and just chat. I loved this class and it seemed like pretty much everyone else did too!",
          "This course would be great if you already have experience in creative writing, but if you've never done it before and are looking to learn how, it's not the best. It is really fun to read everyone's work though and the workshops are very helpful.",
          "That nebulous space between prose and poetry is a space I\u027d never explored before, so that alone made the class valuable to me. It also exposed me to the varied work of authors who wouldn't have otherwise been on my radar. The course reader for this class is something I'll probably actually hold onto for years! The course sharpened my writing and critiquing skills. Not only did I learn from the work of experienced professionals, but I learned from the work of my peers. The classroom was an extremely supportive space, and I was very fortunate to create in such a space. The daily warmups were also very helpful for just greasing the creative gears, and I love the cartoonist's \"grid\" exercise which Professor Donohue showed us. (I'm forgetting the name of both the cartoonist and the exercise.)",
          "This course was a great way to write and get feedback from your peers. The stories assigned were interesting. It took some time to gain momentum.",
          "Hands down the best professor I've had this quarter. I love the workshops, I love the readings, and most of all, I love SPD - she's equal parts no-nonsense and a complete sweetheart. Criticism is brutal, but in a really good way; she knows exactly what's wrong with your piece and how to improve it, although the latter she leaves up to you - after all, that's part of the challenge of writing.",
          "Easily my favorite course that I took all quarter. The subject material is outstanding, class is always stimulating, and Professor Donohue is truly a passionate professor who cares about her students and their learning. Take this class!!",
          "We read some amazing pieces, but I was hoping to develop more of a writing habit than I was able to. There was very little writing expected and we spent a lot more time on poetry than I thought we were going to. For that reason, I thought the creative nonfiction and especially the fiction units were cut short.",
          "I loved this course, and it actually encouraged me to switch out of Medill and pursue the creative writing program. I cannot stress enough how fulfilling this course is.",
          "LOVED this class. Professor Donohue is incredibly receptive and encouraging. We read lots of interesting pieces (fiction, poetry, nonfiction) which really helped me as a writer. Also, workshopping your piece with the whole class, while daunting, is a very valuable experience",
          "If you like creative writing, or think you might, TAKE THIS! I had no real prior experience in creative writing"

          "I loved how in-depth the analysis of literature was in helping us understand America in the 20th century. If I had read the books myself, I would never have been able to understand so many things or \"see\" what these sentences actually mean or what the characters feel. The best thing about the course is that all the four books are a delight to read and they are connected in an extricable manner so you will find yourself going \"oooh\" and \"aaah\" at the end of it. The writings and papers were not overwhelming so it's a great class to take.",
          "It was a good class for a distribution. The texts are very interesting, Professor Cutler is very energetic and makes lectures fun, and the workload is manageable.",
          "Very little work outside of class, other than reading and two very short essays (one was 3-4 pages, one was 4-5, and they were just text analysis). Professor Cutler is very easy to listen to; his lectures are amusing and the information he focuses on is interesting and adds to your experience of the text.",
          "Amazing class, the books we read were incredible and the discussions were enlightening and engaging.",
          "Prof. Cutler is extremely engaging, clearly invested and passionate about the topic, keen to explain the historical contexts of all the texts we read, and really a hilarious hilarious lecturer. I learned a lot about the conflicting aspects and evolvement of the American century. The class was really interesting to take as an immigrant, and really for anyone. A lot of classic texts that you're always told to read but never get to are included. 10/10 would recommend",
          "This class covers the 1900s-2000s literature of America. Books are: The Sun Also Rises, Giovanni's Room, The Woman Warrior, and The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. Will talk about sexuality, Americanness, travel, cultural differences, and assimilation. Culture is the man as a professor, take it with him",
          "This class is great. Professor Cutler is very funny and does a great job of making the material easy to relate to.",
          "Take this class",
          "Awesome distro! I am such a slow reader and this reading work load was perfect for me. Read four book and some other short stories which I all found super interesting. Cutler is really cool and interesting and does a great job as a lecturer.",
          "Prof Cutler was kind of condescending and I feel like he only chose texts that he felt personal connections to. A lot of his commentary was about books he'd recommend but I don't really see why anyone cares. Also, he'd unnecessarily humiliate students in class if their phone accidentally went off. The books were okay but the final exam is annoying like why not just have a final paper? The TA's also didn't grade equally either.",
          "This is a great English class. The books we read were wonderful (The Sun Also Rises, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, etc.) and effectively cover a wide range of cultural trends and anxieties in 20th century America. Class discussions were interesting and engaging.",
          "The course was very enjoyable, especially the lectures. Professor Cutler is very funny and is a very engaging lecturer",
          "I overall enjoyed this course, but sometimes I felt that many of the topics we related to the book were actually very unrelated and stretching things a bit, so it could get confusing. But it was engaging and challenged you.",
          "This is a great class to take!!! Professor Cutler is amazing and I truly learned a lot",
          "not necessarily an easy A but pretty interesting and good books, professor was awesome",
          "This class was so amazing! Professor Cutler was truly the best professor I have had all year and I would love to take a class with him again! I recommend this class to anyone because the books were very easy reads, the class was pretty laid back, and the professor was extremely engaging and just an all around amazing lecturer and person.",
          "This is seriously an amazing class to take. The texts are enjoyable to read, and Cutler is great",
          "This class was great. 10/10 would recommend for an easy english distro that is interesting. Professor Cutler is incredible. Everything he says makes you want to give him a standing ovation and a kiss. The reading was good, fair amount but doable. Don't miss the quizzes though. The poetry wasn't bad and I really enjoyed reading all of the novels except for Woman Warrior. The two papers are easy and the final is kind of pointless.",
          "Professor Cutler is the man. The books are amazing. I'm a science kid who tried to expand my skills in reading and writing, and this course was perfect.",
          "This is a great class. Not only is it super interesting, the reading is great and Professor Cutler is the best. It's not the most work intensive but I definitely feel like I got something out of it.",
          "Professor Cutler is PHENOMENAL! Take this class! There's a lot of reading but all of the books are amazing and you'll learn so much about various parts of America during the 20th century. Every lecture was so interesting and there was never a dull moment in class!",
          "This was an absolutely amazing course. I thoroughly enjoyed not only all of the texts we read, and Cutler makes incredibly insightful points about each of them and opens your eyes to extremely important but oftentimes subtle textual clues. He's also totally cool and makes class so fun to come to because he's engaging, fun, and easy to connect with. One of the best classes I've taken yet and makes me want to take English throughout my time here.",
          "Professor Cutler is the bomb.",
          "Prof Cutler is funny and engaging and makes class enjoyable! That being said I don't think i learned that much...he kinda just throws themes and vocab words at you and I think the only reason a lot of people go to lecture if because they take attendance...I liked the books and overall a pretty easy/enjoyable class but I had higher expectations given the good CTECs",
          "Great distro. Cutler is an engaging lecturer and the assignments are fairly interesting.",
          "Really interesting books, professor was entertaining in lecture and very good with communication.",
          "The style of this course was extremely conducive: required attendance, key terms, essays",
          "not a lot of work for a lit distro (two 5 page papers and a final), read some interesting books, Professor Cutler is a cool guy",
          "Great distro. Cutler is the best, the work isn't that bad, and the readings are interesting. Definitely a must take class",
          "This course is absolutely fantastic and Prof. Cutler is probably my favorite professor I've had so far. Yes, there is a decent bit of reading, but most books are on Shmoop or Sparknotes. Some of the books are eh re. The Woman Warrior, but other books and short readings are absolutely amazing. Prof. Cutler is so passionate and is honestly just a boss. He makes class fun, and I can't stress that enough, especially from someone who wasn't that hyped about taking the class.",
          "Good Distr",
          "Take a different literature distro. Workload is a bit much, and the quizzes and final can be tough.",
          "This class was amazing. Cutler is a great professor and leads interesting discussions in lecture. HE IS SO WOKE. The readings are pretty easy to understand. Erin was a great TA, she was really helpful and sweet.",
          "I loved Cutler's teaching style--he is absolutely engaging and riveting as a lecturer",
          "A lot of reading, but that should e expected. Loved the materials, hated the essays, although they are pretty reasonable length (4-5 pages). The professors voice was my favorite part of this class; I could literally listen to him talk for hours",
          "Professor was good to listen to during lecture, discussion was a little rough to get through some weeks and are majority offered at night",
          "Too much reading. Readings were lame. Recommend some other teacher even though he is an ok lecturer. Essay required close reading which sucked. Pop-quizes were basic plot but knowing we have a lot of work beside this class, this is pretty much idiotic. 3/10",
          "Overall, solid course. Not too hard, not too easy, very reasonable amount of work assigned. There are probably easier options if you're looking to get an English distro, but this one is good for people who want a good balance of work and difficulty.",
          "Professor Cutler is amazing. He makes the class really enjoyable and engaging and I would recommend this class to anyone interested in modern literature and the construction of American culture. Reading for this class never felt like a chore as all the material was extremely thought provoking and interesting. Also, his slide shows are amazing and technologically incomparable.",
          "Great class, Professor Cutler is great! Love the stuff you read: Hemingway, Junot D\u00eeaz, George Saunders, James Baldwin, Walt Whitman. Definitely a good class to take if you're looking for a way to read these authors.",
          "I recoommend this class to anyone looking for a good, general English class. It is not super high-level, so I think it would be very manageable for non-English majors. It is a good step in determining if you have an interest in the subject and would be interested in taking higher-level courses later on. Overall a great class, great prof and TAs, interesting reads."

          "The array of readings covers many different subjects, authors, and time periods. Books include classics like The Sun Also Rises to newer books like the Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. Lecture is engaging and feels like you are in a small seminar class, Professor Cutler learned everyone's names and engages the class through questions throughout lecture.",
          "I really enjoyed the novels we read and I enjoyed the perspective of the narratives. I occasionally felt that if I didn't have the exact same political views as the authors or as the professor, that I was being judged (because the class is very politically charged--which is awesome, but the perspectives we were reading were relatively homogeneous). Cutler was awesome; he's an amazing teacher.",
          "The selection of books and readings in this class is absolutely perfect, and the amount of homework is definitely not too much to handle. Furthermore, Professor Cutler is extremely insightful and adds so much dimension to each of the readings, bringing in history, contemporary issues, and literary allusions in order to enhance the experience of reading the books.",
          "Professor Cutler is a great instruction and I learned a tremendous amount in this class. I came to lecture interested and was not disappointed by the lectures. Professor Cutler brings in a great deal of material outside of the four novels to further edify the course.",
          "I really enjoyed the books we were assigned to read, but sometimes struggled to keep focus during lectures.",
          "Professor Cutler is so chill. I don't know what it is about him that makes me laugh, but lecture was never a struggle to sit through because of him. This was my first english class in college and I\u027d say it's relatively easy and a good distro. I really enjoyed the things we read in this class which also made it a lot more enjoyable. Reading for this class never really felt like a chore.",
          "I loved this course and going to class. I thought the instruction was great and I liked most of the books.",
          "I LOVED almost everything we read in this class, but I disliked Professor Cutler's attitude and teaching style. I found that most of the class was spent listening to other students share their opinions, which were often redundant or uninformed, instead of actually learning from someone with expertise in this field. I don't mind discussion, but not when it is the primary teaching method in a 60-person introductory lecture class. Professor Cutler can also be condescending and definitely thinks because he's a \"cool, hip\" professor and that gives him license to make poorly timed or mildly inappropriate jokes.",
          "Professor Cutler is awesome - super nice and really passionate and intelligent in regards to the material he teachers. The readings were great (in particular the novels) and overall there is very little time commitment outside of the readings (which take an hour/hour and a half at most and you have 2-3 a week). Grading was very generous as well, but that might've been a TA specific thing.",
          "This class is very good, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an engaging distribution. Professor Cutler is a very intelligent and funny lecturer and I was very lucky to take this class. He is a bit too ambitious in terms of the readings that he assigns, but otherwise its a great class.",
          "I enjoyed the course a ton. Some of the extra readings (poems/short stories) were not always intriguing, but the books were very interesting. I learned a lot about how to analyze texts and think critically.",
          "I loved this course. Professor Cutler is an engaging lecturer and all of the books and short stories were interesting and Professor Cutler did a great job of providing context and meaning to the pieces. I learned so much in this course and really enjoyed class as well as doing my homework. Would definitely recommend.",
          "Fun",
          "This is a good class for distros; it's a pretty easy English class. Lectures are really boring but it's with 10% of the grade so it's an easy A and you might as well go. There's only one short essay, which is rare for an English class. The books we read are actually really good and interesting, and Cutler for the most part is a pretty good lecturer. There are 5 reading quizzes but they're super easy.",
          "This is a great class! Professor Cutler is a fantastic professor who has a lot of passion for what he teaches, and the books we read in class were all very interesting. There were 6 quizzes throughout the quarter, which were easy if you had done the reading, and you can drop your lowest quiz score at the end of the quarter. There was also one essay, one group project, and a final exam.",
          "Professor Cutler is one of the best professors I have had at Northwestern. As a freshman I was told to take one of his courses before I graduated and I took this course now as a senior for fun. He's extremely knowledgable and the way this course was designed was enlightening. I also enjoyed that it was part of the Hewlett diversity initiative. I highly recommend taking this class or any other class with Professor Cutler.",
          "Let's start with grading: I felt I was graded quite harshly on the only essay we had, and I do not think the TA really understood my argument, so I felt frustrated in that respect. The final exam: very, very difficult. I didn't expect it to be so challenging--especially the essay questions at the end. Also, the formatting of the final was not ideal. You had two sections that accounted for 55% of your grade and then a final section that accounted for 45% of your grade. However, I would say you spent 2\u02f3 of your time on the first two sections, and only a third of your time on the essay. Consequently, the grading breakdown should have weighted the first two sections (which were only 55%) more strongly (maybe 66%?) than the final essay section. Also, I though the essay questions were just poorly crafted--I don't think they reflected the themes we studied in the course, and I don't think they gave you a good chance of making a strong argument. I felt shoved into a corner by the essay questions because of how broad and overarching they were (not specific at all). Also, frankly, the story map project was a very bad idea. I appreciate that Cutler was trying to shake up the standard english assignment, but this format just felt forced: like putting a square peg in a round hole. There were various software issues with the Knight Lab story map, and it was really challenging to overcome those pernicious bugs in the software. Let's face it, you should be challenged by the argument you make in your story map and having to work with the text, not the limitations of a software program. So, I felt like that assignment was quite forced and it was not fitting for our course. That being said, I think I also received a very generous grade for the story map. I was surprised that I got a 93, given that our map was not great. So they were lenient there. In terms of instruction, I think Cutler is a good professor and he has a lot of enthusiasm. He does a good job preparing for lecture and bringing in supplementary texts and ideas. I don't think all of his supplementary materials for lecture hit the mark, but I give him credit for trying. I also believe he's well-intentioned with his assignments and overall expectations, so I give him credit there. TAs were very nice--discussion section certainly wasn't mind blowing and I often found it was something I went to out of an obligation rather than interest, but what can you do--they are required. And the last thing I'll say: In terms of subject matter I think this course is effective at bringing in minority voices, but ultimately I think it overlooks the greatest works of American literature in the 20th century. Sure, you've got the Sun Also Rises, and even the Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao (which is a great book, but I don't think it belongs on the list because it was written in 2007!), but Typical American should not be on there. It is a decent work of literature and I do respect Gish Jen, but it certainly has no place in a course that surveys strong works of American Literature of the 20th century--it is nowhere near the quality of other works of American literature which I would have liked to see appear in this course; to name a few: Ellison's the Invisible Man, anything by Faulkner (Light in August, the Sound and the Fury, short fiction such as Barn Burning or A Rose for Emily), Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, Cather's My Antonia, Hansberry's A raisin in the Sun, Wright's Native Son, the list goes on! I give Cutler credit for trying to incorporate minority voices into a narrative of American literature that has been dominated by white writers, but I still question his choices. There is so much in the way of literature written and based on non-white voices: Richard Wright! Sherman Alexie! Amy Tan! Lastly, I can't mention these stories without expressing my loathing for Flowering Judas by Katherine Anne Porter; I don't even know where to begin there, but I really wish we hadn't read that story especially because it's connections to American literature, in my opinion, are somewhat dubious (again you could have thrown in a Faulkner short story or another Baldwin essay in its place). Anyways, respect to Cutler for trying to open the narrative and broaden the historically exclusive white-dominated canon--he hit the mark with some assignments like the yusef komunyakaa poems, countee cullen poems, Baldwin readings, Larsen's Passing, but I would have liked to see some better picks overall if you are going to teach a course in 20th century America literature--this was more of a class about minority voices in literature (a la Cutler) since the 1920s then it was a course on 20th century American literature. For those of you reading this down the road, I suggest you look at the syllabus and course readings beforehand, so you know what you're getting to. The title of the class is deceiving, and in the end the books and readings make the course not the professor and the TAs. I always say you can enjoy a class with a bad professor but strong subject matter, but you can't enjoy a class with a good professor and bad subject matter. This class was a case of a good professor and decent subject matter--but again, the poems, readings, and supplementary material mean everything, so get to know the syllabus before you throw yourself into this class.",
          "Professor Cutler is one of the best at NU and this class offers a great mix of authors like Hemingway and contemporary voices such as Junot D\u00edaz.",
          "All the readings are interesting (especially the books; the books are awesome) and teach you something new about some of the problems that were present in the 20th century. The reading quizzes are fairly easy if you read although some can get a little tricky. Usually if you put something that sort of makes sense then they will give you full points. The first analytical project is a paper which is difficult because it is a close reading of a text. I did not do a great job yet still got a B which was fine. The second project is a group project and that was really good and fun. The final is difficult but made sense and ultimately this is a great english class. Thoroughly enjoyed it!!!!!!!!!!",
          "Good basic introduction class/requirement :)",
          "not an easy course but the professor has some insightful thoughts on the course material and there is knowledge to be gained; a solid amount of reading that must be done to keep up with the class and the quasi-weekly quizzes; however doing just this much (reading, quizzes and class notes) makes the midterm paper and final exam fair (but not easy); group project in addition to midterm paper and final exam is not tough.",
          "AMAZING teacher. SUPER interesting material. would highly recommend.",
          "Everything about this course was wonderful and you should all take this course.",
          "LITERALLY THE BEST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN AT NU! I was not thrilled about enrolling in a literature class because they tend to be centered on white folks and seldom include the narratives of POC. But this class was a pleasant surprise! There was so much diverse literature. In each class Professor Cutler asked questions that made us think about race. Sometimes it was a conversation with a character in the book that could easily be glanced over but had greater meaning in understanding the novel. Cutler is an amazing lecturer and the lectures are structured. Everything about the course is amazing. My TA was the best! S/O to Delali. I CANNOT SAY THIS ENOUGH- If you are hesitant to take a literature course because you feel like they tend to center on and celebrate whiteness, this class does not. PLEASE TAKE IT.Especially my POC. Its Lit!",
          "It was fascinating to be taught that so many American issues are the fault of society far more than they are the responsibility of the individual. Our discussions over how affairs can liberate oppressed women from heteropatriarchal structures proved especially fascinating.",
          "I liked this class because we read literature (books, poems, and short stories) from a diverse set of authors, which meant the course incorporated many different perspectives. You have to make sure to keep up with the reading in order to follow class discussions and do well on the pop quizzes. Grading depends on the TA. I thought the project and paper were interesting, and it intimidated me a little bit to have an in-class final exam, but if you keep up with the reading and you take good in-class notes you'll feel prepared.",
          "Good class for a distro, learned a lot around the theme of class/race/gender\u02fetc divisions in America",
          "Professor Cutler is great, the course content is extremely interesting.",
          "Professor Cutler is very engaging and charismatic, albeit a bit fake. His lectures are always incredibly interesting. However, some of the texts he chose were painful to drag through.",
          "Lectures were always engaging, as were discussion sections. I was a big fan of the readings and Professor Cutler does a great job of teaching students how to analyze literature according to historical and cultural context.",
          "Professor Cutler is a great professor, and while the class is fast paced, I found the readings to be enjoyable.",
          "This class was great! I've never really enjoyed an English class, but this class I actually looked forward to attending most weeks. I loved all of the materials we read in class and the professor was really cool. The class was also graded very fairly, so as long as you actually did the readings (which most people did anyways since it was always interesting), then the quizzes were a breeze.",
          "WONDERFUL CLASS. Prof Cutler is extremely eloquent and engaging--lecture was very enjoyable and the readings were also great. Make sure to keep up with them though, because the reading quiz grade could pull down your overall grade quite a bit. Decent amount of reading, but manageable and so interesting!!",
          "This is such a good class. Professor Cutler is such a dynamic lecturer. The books are fairly quick reads and the whole class is really interesting.",
          "Solid lit distro.",
          "The class was well scheduled. The readings were never too long and were interesting. The quizzes help you stay on top of everything. Discussion sessions were interesting. Cutler is the most amazing professor...cannot recommend him enough!!",
          "This class was a great english class for people who are interested in modern literature and the cross-section between english and history. Most of the readings were really interesting and not too challenging. The work was manageable (especially for an english class where there could be a lot of reading). The quizzes were very fair and it is relatively easy to do well if you attend class and discussion because participation\u02fattendance encompasses 25% of your grade. GREAT DISTRO.",
          "Professor Cutler is incredibly kind, and does a nice job of making his lectures easy to follow and interesting.",
          "Cutler is an engaging speaker, reading quizzes are not hard, discussion group is good",
          "I was pleasantly surprised by the multiple aspects we took on as a class to be understand what exactly \"The American Century\" was. I loved most of the readings and how the intersectional stories further explained a complete picture of what America was and in some ways continues to be. Loved the enthusiasm of the class, would recommend.",
          "I really liked this class. I enjoyed all of the books we read, and lectures were always really interesting.",
          "Amazing english class, would highly recommend for a distro. Lectures were interesting and were a combination of lit and history. The books, short stories, and poems were amazing, and we read work by all different authors -- rather than just straight white old men, like you sometimes do in a Lit class. Reading was easy, just one essay, a project, a final, and five quizzes in class that were fine if you did the reading or read summaries online.",
          "This class was way better than I expected it to be and I really enjoyed the required reading and the lectures complimented them. This professor is awesome. Definitely take this class!",
          "Professor Cutler is a great lecturer and the class was a manageable amount of reading with great texts. There were a handful of reading quizzes that were easy to do well on as long as you did the readings, but there's only a few big assignments that make it hard to make up your grade if you don't get A's.",
          "This is a great class! Professor Cutler is kind and encourages student participation. I learned a lot about issues such as race, gender, and violence and how they evolved over the past 100 years or so. I also liked the variety of projects that we got to do.",
          "English-273 provides a really interesting reading into some really great books. As long as you keep up with the reading, you'll be intrigued in class. I gained a much deeper appreciation for English and as a result, am now considering it as a major.",
          "This course was extraordinarily effective in exploring the 20th century through the lens of diverse writers and thinkers, offering a brand new perspective to a seemingly fossilized period of American history. I loved reading American literature that covered a broad swath of American life, and found this extremely valuable in reexamining what I thought I knew about America.",
          "The texts were definitely different than what I thought they were going to be, but helped me look at the American experience from a multicultural perspective. A fair bit of reading, but totally interesting and worth it.",
          "Awesome course, as long as you go to lecture and discussions should be an easy A",
          "I can't say enough good things about this class. The lectures are fascinating, the reading material is amazing, the TAs are great and Professor Cutler is the most amazing teacher in the world. There's a lot of reading but it's manageable, there are only two major assignments and one final, along with a few reading quizzes that are easy if you've done the reading. Take this class!!!!",
          "Cutler is a very knowledgable professor on the subject, is a well-prepared lecturer, and this class had a lot of potential. Unfortunately, the political views and textual interpretations of the instructors were basically presented to us as fact and jammed down our throats. If you write a well-argued paper from a viewpoint that doesn't line up with your TA, your grade will suffer as a result. There is little tolerance for opposing viewpoints in this class.",
          "Professor Cutler is an amazing professor. He's clearly very interested in the course material and uses a bit of humor here and there to keep the class interesting. I personally thoroughly enjoyed the readings that we did (not much of a poem person, but the novels and short stories we read were definitely up my alley). Cutler's array of readings were obviously intended to cover the American experience from diverse racial perspectives, and he covers a bit of American history in lecture as context for the novels, which I found helpful. The comprehension quizzes in class are easy if you've done the reading."

          "The professor cared about us and didn\u2019t try and over complicate unnecessarily.",
          "Seth is a fun professor, really makes the material accessible. The course often felt like it was more about each of the individual adaptations we looked at, rather than adaptation as a subject",
          "Seth is a really good guy and cares about his students. As for the content of the course, it was a little too political/historical for my taste. Papers didn't really have prompts but were just different types of papers, which was helpful for working on close reading.",
          "I really enjoyed this course. Great teacher. Not too hard, the readings are fun but you can get by without them (not recommended). I enjoyed the structure of this class. The marrying between theatre and english was lovely.",
          "Seth is a super awesome and hilarious guy and I would definitely recommend taking a class with him. He was definitely the best part of the class. Obviously if you don't like Shakespeare you wouldn't be interested in this because the entire class revolves around his works and adaptations. The class is only a 2-page paper, a 4-5 page paper, a 8-9 final page paper, and a discussion leading session where you lead the class for 20 minutes with a partner. The reading and workload was pretty manageable. Seth is not an easy grader but all of his comments for each of our essays were very helpful and for the final paper he even allowed us to submit an extended bibliography and then a rough draft which was super helpful. You can also always email him with questions if you're having trouble and need help with your writing. He's a super nice guy and genuinely wanted everyone in the class to succeed. The only thing I didn't love about the class was I wish that the movies we watched were better and more of the very popular Shakespeare adaptations (like the Lion king, romeo + juliet, 10 things i hate about you). I didn't like any of the films except for Scotland PA, however all of the readings were either classic Shakespeare (Macbeth, Hamlet, King Lear, sonnets) or some sort of adaptation which was interesting. I'm not a huge Shakespeare person but the class was still fun and it was interesting to see what inspired Shakespeare and what works were inspired by him. Overall I would recommend this or another class with Seth because he was a great professor and I learned a lot.",
          "The class was fun and Seth is great, but overall it wasn't very interesting or challenging and I didn't learn anything new. It wasn't exactly an easy A, but it was an easy class.",
          "interesting readings, chill professor, lots of discussion, i really liked it",
          "I loved this class a lot. Professor Swanner is one of the best professors I've ever had. He is so funny and engaging, and also makes himself extremely available for questions or just to talk with students. He is truly wonderful, and everyone should absolutely take a class with him if you have the opportunity, he is just the best. The structure of the class itself was also great. The course material was extremely varied but never felt disparate or unrelated. We spent just enough time on each text, so it never felt like we read or watched something for no reason, but also never felt like we were beating a dead horse. I loved this class, absolutely take it if its something you're interested in.",
          "Personally am not a fan of Shakespeare, but this class is made bearable because Seth is one of the most awesome English teachers at Northwestern. He is fun to talk to, clear with his expectations and instructions, offers very useful feedback, and brings 120% enthusiasm to every class. He appreciates what big or little contribution you made in class.",
          "I liked the course overall, but it was a little boring sometimes. I think this is mostly because early modern texts can be dull and hard to access.. Also basically every class professor Swanner decided to re-teach us how to support claims with textual evidence which became redundant. A lot of the activities and games we had to do weren't really engaging, just a way to force people to dig through their books to support crazy claims. After the 3rd or 4th time, we get it."

          "This was a great class. If you're a theatre major looking to fulfill a His/Lit\u02fcrit class, take this. You read four tragedies and write 3 papers - a short response paper, a midterm, and then a final one. Most of the class is discussion. Sucich is a bit of a tough grader - not unreasonably so, but you need to pay attention and be a fairly good writer. He's really enthusiastic during class and good at facilitating discussion.",
          "This class was fantastic. Even though I didn't take this class for any requirement, I didn't feel like it was inaccessible for non-English majors. The lectures were both thoughtful and thought-provoking, and I gained insight into the plays we read that I've never considered before. The assignments were very manageable, and we were encouraged to write on any topics that interested us, rather than having set requirements for a paper.",
          "The Glenn Sucich is an amazing teacher who really piques your interest in the Shakespearean tragedies. If you do the assigned readings and read the given text, you will have no problem keeping up in class. I loved how the class was mainly a discussion rather than a lecture, but it also means you need to speak up, even if you may feel your critical insight is not as wow-worthy as others'. The final research essay (7-8 pages of original writing or 9-10 pages including research based on a previous essay) was really not that bad at all.",
          "I appreciated how engaged and interesting the lectures were. It felt very worth while to come to class.",
          "This class was slightly disappointing. I'm an English major, and I feel that the class catered too much to the large number of theater students in the class. There was, in my opinion, not enough literary analysis, and too much generality. One of the major problems is that the professor would allow the theater students to talk for almost the entire class, which was irritating because the discussions would invariably devolve into boring nonsense. This was particularly annoying because Prof. Sucich is clearly very knowledgeable and passionate about Renaissance literature, and I would have liked to hear more about what he thought about the plays. There was one class on Macbeth where he went through the sounds of the play (i.e., assonance and consonance and alliteration) which was by far the best class and should have been the model for every class.",
          "This is a great course to read Shakespeare's greatest plays. I would recommend it to anyone with any amount of experience with Shakespeare, whether they like Shakespeare or not.",
          "I loved coming to this class. Glenn is always so passionate and enthusiastic about the work we're doing and genuinely wants to hear what people have to say. We read Othello, King Lear, Macbeth, and Coriolanus, but I think he\u027d be willing to change the tragedies depending on class preference. He places a lot of value in class participation and most of the class is based on discussion. He was very reasonable in assigning reading -- we usually read each play over the course of a week and a half and discussed the acts separately before addressing the plays as a whole. If you're at all interested in Shakespeare, definitely take this class because it's stimulating and there's something in it for everyone.",
          "This is an amazing course. A fair amount of reading (4 Shakespeare plays in 1 quarter), but balanced out with only a couple papers and really interesting discussions of the topics in the plays and why they are still relevant today. Prof. Sucich is an amazing lecturer, made the course extremely engaging, and made himself available to meet for extremely helpful office hours.",
          "I LOVED THIS COURSE! Professor Sucich is fabulous and really funny, he knows the material so well and drops really brilliant knowledge as if it was obvious. This was a great course and made me look at texts I\u027d already read in a new light.",
          "Glenn is a fantastic professor. Every class with him is extremely interesting, and enjoyable to attend. There is a perfect balance between lecture and discussion, and I left the class feeling much more knowledgable about the works of Shakespeare.",
          "GREAT PROFESSOR. Sometimes lets students dictate too much of the conversation in my opinion. I also hated Shakespeare going into the class and hoped Glenn would be able to change my mind, but he didn't and I still hate Shakespeare.",
          "Great course! Professor Sucich offers really interesting insights into Shakespeare.",
          "This is an amazing class; all the class discussions were involved, casual, yet intellectual. Prof. Sucich developed a culture in the classroom where people talked about what they found interesting or cool about the plays and how those ideas or concepts related to the world at large. The reading was not a crazy amount because it was paced very well. 10\u2f10",
          "Prof Sucich is absolutely great! So enthusiastic and knowledgeable! Very lax about extensions with papers. A lot of reading and just a few papers, so not too much work, but a fair amount. Great class though, and great professor. Would absolutely recommend.",
          "This is a great, great, great course for Shakespearean tragedies. Prof. Sucich is an amazing professor who clearly loves and understands the plays. Discussions were always engaging and interesting, and the chosen plays were all incredible as well. 10\u2f10, would recommend to anyone with a vague interest in Shakespeare or the most robust Shakespeare lover",
          "Great professor! Loved the class discussions and essay feedback was VERY helpful.",
          "This class was fantastic and an amazing entry into Shakespeare if you haven't read his works previously. Glenn is a spectacular, engaging professor. My only complaint would be that he often let the class discussions be managed by a select group of theater majors who honestly didn't ever say anything all that interesting. I think if the class' orientation was shifted, ever so slightly, back towards English and focusing on talking about different scholars' interpretations of Shakespeare would make this class truly great. Overall, definitely an easier English class and you can watch the stage productions alongside reading the plays which makes understanding them 10000% easier.",
          "Great class on Shakespeare's tragedies!! Glenn is such an engaging, funny, kind, wonderful prof--highly highly recommend any of his courses. A couple of students tended to dominate the discussion, but Glenn was always able to reign in back in and I felt like I really learned a lot about engaging with the tragedies. Definitely recommend this class!!"

          "I already loved Hamlet before going into this course, and I still love it heading out. We focused a little too much on analyzing other people's analysis for me, though. It felt as though all our discussion in class wasn't about the play, but about different critical papers about it. I ended up considering it more of a class on comparing different critical theories by how they each deal with one text instead of a class on that text. I didn't have a problem with that, but it wasn't what I was expecting, so I thought that was probably a fair thing to mention here in case anyone else thought similarly. That said, I found discussing the history of the play to be one of my favorite things. I especially loved being able to see old quartos and folios from the special collections library one class.",
          "Professor Masten provides challenging and interesting courses while making himself a resource. Loved focusing on one play, getting to really evaluate it from different perspectives!!",
          "Professor Masten is a fabulous instructor and I would highly recommend that all English majors take a course with him before graduating. You will learn so much in his class. The fact that he was able to so easily hold a class's attention while spending an entire quarter on one play is a feat in itself; bringing to life a course focused on literary theory and criticism is another. He fostered a great deal of enthusiasm among the students and the discussions we had in class were really fascinating. It was both a challenging and deeply enjoyable course.",
          "TL;DR **take this course** super interesting, amazing prof, stay on top of readings and it's not really that much work, not just for Shakespeare/theater buffs",
          "Amazing course!! Not offered very often, so if it is, jump on it before it fills up. Prof. Masten is one of the best professors I've had in my time here so far -- engaging, supportive, all around an amazing teacher. The classes where he lectured weren't dull in the slightest, and he tried to keep them mainly discussion-based so that wasn't many. As someone who is sometimes intimidated by \"MUST TALK EVERY CLASS FOR PARTICIPATION\" situations, this was not like that at all -- Prof. Masten appreciates when you talk, but he also keeps an eye out for general engagement, paying attention, understanding of material in papers etc. so I didn't feel pressured to participate just for the sake of contributing something (and I ended up talking most classes anyway, based on the wonderful atmosphere and feeling like I legitimately had things to say). I went to office hours several times and Prof. Masten was incredibly helpful -- would also recommend getting to know him outside of class.",
          "I\u027d read Shakespeare before but had never done Hamlet, and had never had much intellectually stimulating discussing of the plays I\u027d read (@high school English), so this seemed like a good distro to go with to get a better understanding of the Bard while I knocked out my VI. Little intimidating at first but, although there were a lot of theater kids, I didn't feel out of place at all after a while. Not really that much work, either; a good number of readings, but perfectly reasonable in quantity, that introduce a variety of schools of thought about reading literature -- absolutely fascinating. Three papers, two in the middle and then a final.",
          "Hamlet is one of my \"special interests\" so I was excited to take a class for 9 weeks where that's all we talked about. The secondary sources were pretty long and high level, a bit of a chore to plow through, but the discussions were always interesting. I knew Hamlet was culturally far-reaching, but I didn't realize how far exactly. It also made me think about how things like literature can be a foray into the way people thought and lived in the past, which I hadn't thought about as in depth before. Focusing on one play for three months wasn't difficult because I love it, but also the discussions were so varied that it stayed interesting. I recommend if you like combination of lit and history.",
          "I loved the diversity of sources and anaytical lenses we used to interpret Hamlet. I wish the class were structured so that there was less all-class discussion because with everyone talking at once, some people dominated conversations while others said nothing.",
          "This course has a lot of really challenging reading but is really instructive in thinking about critical theories and lenses. It is a lot of work and a lot of Hamlet in a short period of time, but I learned a lot.",
          "Definitely not a course for the faint of heart, as it is challenging, but 100% is rewarding. No other class at Northwestern has improved my critical reading and writing as much as this has, if only because the atmosphere Masten cultivates is one where no ideas are stupid, and every idea can be pushed and stretched and elevated even further than you could initially imagine. Take this course if you love Shakespeare, or Hamlet, or want to think critically about one work and the wide-ranging implications of it throughout history. Very highly recommended.",
          "Professor Masten is great! He is funny and smart, but unfortunately not even his fun energy could mask the fact that this class is absolutely boring. The readings are dull and hard, and I spent most of my class time trying not to fall asleep. If you love studying the differences in grammar between text written in 1604 and 1603, then this is the class for you.",
          "Do you care about Hamlet? Answer that before you take this. Masten\u2019s the best though.",
          "This course made me learn a text in a way I had never learned a singular text before. The papers were graded very harshly, it's not that it was unfair, just harsh. This class was great, but not for the faint of heart.",
          "It is an interesting course! A lot of reading however. Masten is very intelligent though it is cool to hear his thoughts. He also makes a lot of jokes which keeps the mood light. I was not an english major, so this course scared me initially but I ended up enjoying it a lot.",
          "This is an English class, not a theater class! There is an intense focus on critical readings and intellectual approaches to Shakespeare's opus. Scholars, like Professor Masten, know their stuff and have created strong theories about how to interpret Hamlet, which is so cool! Read the class description to see if you want to take this class.",
          "It was really amazing tos pend a whole quarter delving into one Shakespeare play and I feel like I got a lot out of it as a result. Professor Masten is such an expert on Shakespeare and great at guiding the course. The readings were all really interesting and gave a really nice array of critical perspectives on Hamlet. Prof. Masten is also really good at helping develop analytical skills by showing you how to approach complicated critical essays in terms of argument, method, and evidence. The paper topics were helpful in guiding the writing process, but also gave you the flexibility to write about what you were passionate about. My only critique is that it took Prof. Masten a long time to return the first paper (although he had a lot of other stuff happening this quarter, so you can't hold it against him too much). Overall great course, great professor, learned a lot."

          "Professor did not provide a clear syllabus or grade breakdown, nor was the Canvas page ever opened up for the course. While the syllabus provided at the beginning of the course had readings listed by day, the professor would often announce at the start of a session that we would be instead discussing a different play that day. Since no prior information via email or Canvas was given, the majority of students were unable to participate as they had not been able to read the proper play for that particular session. It was unclear whether the professor understood how much of an issue this was, as many sessions were dull (the bulk of classtime was devoted to students reading aloud sections of a play), as students cannot discuss plays that they haven\u2019t read. Classes often ended 10-20 minutes early, which made the course feel unfocused. Professor did not engage with all student comments, focusing primarily on those that reflected his reading of the material. Course felt designed to discourage participation.",
          "The course material itself was very interesting--if you're already interested in Shakespeare or early modern drama in general. I enjoyed the focus on gender politics and representation, and it was useful to read such a broad sampling of Shakespeare's plays to understand trends in his work over time. Drawing connections and comparisons between\u02famong plays was a good approach.",
          "",
          "",
          "However, that is about all that I can say positively about the course. The professor's disorganization and unrealistic expectations made it very frustrating. Class time was almost completely devoted to reading aloud and group discussion, which is absolutely normal and good for an English class, but two factors prevented the discussions from becoming very valuable:",
          "",
          "",
          "1) Prof. Erickson repeatedly departed from the reading schedule on the syllabus. This made it extremely difficult to have good discussions, because obviously most students didn't have much to contribute regarding plays we hadn't read yet. The first time, several of us explicitly said we hadn't read the play he was talking about because it wasn't on the syllabus for that week, but it still happened two or three more times throughout the course, with no warning.",
          "",
          "",
          "2) Prof. Erickson also very obviously expected that the students who enrolled would have more background knowledge and literary analysis skills than they did. He was prepared to teach a 300-level English class on Shakespeare, but since the course was cross-listed in Humanities and had no prerequisites, there were lots of underclassmen, theater majors, etc. This is not a bad thing at all! It's great to have perspectives other than English majors who've taken all the same Shakespeare courses over the years... but Prof. Erickson did not adapt his teaching. Often his questions were difficult to parse, for those of us who aren't as familiar with the scholarly language of Elizabethan drama, and he assumed that we had read other Shakespeare plays when we had not. So there were a LOT of long, awkward silences in our discussions.",
          "",
          "",
          "The IDEA of the course and the materials are very good, and I certainly learned by reading and writing about the plays, but I couldn't recommend the course as taught by Prof. Erickson with the structure that it has. Should've had some prerequisites (not necessarily Intro to Shakespeare, but at least one of the Foundations of Brit\u02fam Lit courses or something similar) so that students would be prepared with the expected skills for productive discussion.",
          "The workload is very minimal, and the professor is clearly passionate about the subject. The two major assignments are open ended enough to allow creativity in your thesis and the texts are engaging. The lectures can be boring and it was sometimes difficult to find the motivation to attend, however.",
          "This is both the least productive and least enjoyable class I have ever taken at northwestern. I went to class every class (which is more than most can say as the 40 person class dropped to 17 after one class and by mid quarter literally 4-8 people showed up to each class because of how bad it was) and just counted the minutes until I could leave. The professor was never prepared and never seemed to have any idea what he was talking about. I was constantly bored and confused because he would somehow seem to talk about nothing for an hour and a half twice a week. I can not warn you enough DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Whatever requirement is may fulfill for you I promise there is a better way to do it."

As much as I enjoyed the class, I would only recommend it to someone who isn't taking any other intensive, time-consuming courses this quarter.",
          "\u2013 It was refreshing to have a lit class where you primarily read, without all the literary criticism and group presentations and canvas posts. It can be an intimidating atmosphere for a quiet student, but Prof. Herbert values each student's contribution and never makes anyone feel inadequate in their comments. He is extremely knowledgable and passionate about Dickens, and even though the works can be dense and there is a lot lot of reading, it's a good feeling to leave a NU course and feel that you have accomplished something. Many english classes these days are focused on more contemporary / non-canonical works, and while those are great too, it was good to read some major classics. Got so much more out of the novels than I would have alone, and they are incredible. Class presentations and paper is manageable. But reading is a lot; be warned.",

Honestly, not worth taking unless you are capable of reading VERY quickly and still understanding. Professor Herbert was nice and the course wasn't too hard, but it was a lot of undue stress.",

Professor Herbert is phenomenal at letting you just read the books and come to conclusions that you can share in an open and safe environment. The books, written 150 years ago, are made ever so relevant and pertinent by his style of teaching. Love this class.",

Christopher Herbert is extremely passionate and knowledgeable on the subject of Charles Dickens and facilitated great discussions by always asking in depth and provocative questions. He is also very kind and encouraging. It is a lot of reading but totally worth it!",

I also loved reading some of the non-conventional Dickens novels.",

The assignments outside of the hefty reading, though, are minimal, and class is discussion-based without real structure.

          "LOVED THIS CLASS!!! Bill Savage has the most unique style of reading novels I've experienced at NU and I had so much to learn in this class. Really great texts chosen and class discussions are incredibly dynamic. Savage is so flexible with how the class is tested in terms of paper due date scheduling, and I've never had a professor make his students' wishes such a high priority. This class is designed around the specific students in the class, could not recommend more.",
          "Savage has clear expectations while still providing options for students. He approaches the text with great knowledge of its background and interaction with modern America. His class discussions are meaningful, and allow for students to contribute fully without getting off topic. There's a lot of reading to do, but all of the texts are good reads so it doesn't feel laborious.",
          "I loved this course and found it very compelling. The books we read were fascinating and chronologically painted a very interesting development of American identity over time. I was challenged intellectually and in course conversations, and found the discussions we had in the class some of the most engaging discussions I've had in any Northwestern class.",
          "This course kicked my butt. I'm a sophomore poli sci major and this is my first college english class. I was definitely way underqualified for this course, but it was also one of the most rewarding classes I've ever taken. I learned TONS about America, and myself, and how I think about the world. I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED, this class, but don't take it if you're looking for a relaxed english distro with a famous sex-advice columnist's brother.",
          "Bill is an understandable, understanding, and engaging professor to be in class with. He makes discussions fun and the books we read were really thought-provoking. Never a time where I didn't enjoy this course.",
          "I expected this to be a challenging course that would make my writing better. It did that and more. I really appreciated the opportunities to re-write papers because I felt that really helped me gain a better idea of how to improve future papers. I also think the response papers allowed me to read the novels more closely and pick up on things I never would have. Class discussions were always very interesting and I always looked forward to what Professor Savage had to say about the novels we read.",
          "I think this class does not present many different opinions of America,",
          "This course can be hard at times and necessitates a lot of reading, but the discussions in class are worth putting in the effort. Professor Savage delves into what being an American means, and how identity serves as a critical component of the American experiences. The class not only engaged me, but his edits on my essay really provided good criticism to improve my writing in the future.",
          "Excellent course, especially for a non-English major like myself. One of the best courses I've taken at Northwestern, gives you a newfound appreciation of reading novels, and a better understanding of the American literary canon. You get to explore really interesting concepts of identity as well as various ways new ways to understand literature.",
          "Prof. Savage is amazing and course texts were interesting. ~1 book/week, so there's significant work out of class. Savage gives a lot of options for course assignments to work with different types of students.",
          "I LOVED THIS CLASS. This was my favorite course I've taken at Northwestern. I really enjoyed getting to read a wide variety of American novels, even if it was often one novel per week, which can be taxing. It's predominantly a discussion class, so you'll get a lot more out of it if you do the reading and talk. Bill Savage is a great professor and he includes some interesting lectures on what it means to be a part of a literary canon.",
          "I would recommend this course to anyone at Northwestern, even people who aren't majoring in English. I learned more in this class than I think I learned in my entire junior year. Everything feels relevant and contemporary.",
          "This course is challenging but Professor Savage is excellent. Don't take it if you're not willing to do a decent amount of reading. If you don't read the novels you won't get anything out of the class.",
          "awesome course",
          "As close to a \"life-changing class\" I've had at NU. Bill Savage is brilliant, and if you're game for some fast-moving, intricate discussions about identity/the texts, you'll love this class. It's challenging; Bill's a tough grader, but he takes pains to explain what makes a successful argument, paper, sentence, etc. It's a time commitment, too, roughly one novel a week (except a little breather around Weeks 5 and 6, which is nice) but it's one of the most rewarding experiences I've had at NU. Take this class!",
          "I'm working on a creative writing minor, so I sort of had to take this class, but it ended up being one of the most interesting classes I've taken at Northwestern. I knew coming into this class that it would be a challenge \u2014 I've never taken a 300-level English class before \u2014 and felt that I was able to improve my critical reading and writing skills, which was my main goal. I felt the one drawback was that the class discussions moved too quickly. Often, the class was on its second or third \u027direct response' by the time I could think of something to say for the original statement. Other than that this class met or surpassed all of my expectations.",
          "This is one of the best, if not the best, classes I've taken at Northwestern. It made me think in new ways about what it means to be American, and about how this country has evolved since its conception. The weekly reading responses made me stay up to date with the reading and hone my writing skills. The class discussions were some of the most interesting I've ever participated in -- I'm not sure whether that was a result of the students in the class or Professor Savage's teaching style or both. The classes were a mix of open discussion about the texts and Professor Savage lecturing about the historical context of what we had read. If you want to sharpen your reading and writing skills AND learn a ton about American history, take this class.",
          "Again, I loved all the material Professor Savage used in this class, as he presented totally unique views on works that students are likely to have encountered before",
          "This is a fantastic course. TAKE IT. There's an awesome reading list and Professor Savage is the best English teacher I've had at Northwestern. This course does require a significant amount of reading - about a novel a week - but it's so worth it. This class made me consider the American identity in ways that I never had before. Plus, there are lots of options for how you are evaluated in the class - Professor Savage allows you to choose how many essays you want to write for the class and then weights them accordingly. Great for all levels of writers because of that. The discussion was always engaging and very thought-provoking. Cannot stress this enough. This is a wonderful class and you should TAKE IT."

          "Really enjoyed this class!! I genuinely enjoyed all of the novels we read, and discussion was productive. Prof. Johnson was great!",
          "Professor Johnson was really interested in teaching intersectionality and while I really commend her for doing so, as a student of color it felt very basic and often the professor wasn't great at challenging students on their perceptions of topics like race and gender, which lead to certain students saying wild statements in class without the professor commenting at all. This wasn't helped by the fact that class is based entirely around student run discussion, which could range from really great and insightful to utterly quiet.",
          "Pretty good course, the professor clearly cares and put a lot of effort into finding some great reading selections",
          "This is my favorite English class I have taken at NU so far. Professor Johnson is amazing\u2013 she is very friendly and passionate, but also expects a lot from her students and is good at inspiring everyone to give their full attention and efforts to the class. I found the reading and assignments to be manageable, and Professor Johnson was great at teaching without preaching/lecturing\u2013 she let students lead the discussion while still guiding us and helping us see things from a new point of view. She also helped us unpack and think more critically about ideas like intersectionality, representation and diversity that people tend to throw around but don't always fully understand. The materials we read were incredibly interesting, and I found that Professor Johnson was a very fair grader for students that participated, did the reading and engaged with the concepts. This course tackles incredibly important issues and everyone should take it!",
          "Professor Johnson is a really thoughtful and helpful professor, and it's clear she really cares about her students. The texts we read were great and the work was manageable, yet interesting. Recommend!",
          "Excellent syllabus/materials. Usually survey-type courses (variety of materials\u02fbig range) are all over the place, but the themes of the course were clearly applied for each and every reading. I found this course extremely valuable and it's the best English class I've taken. Prof Johnson is great to meet with during office hours and genuinely wants you to improve your writing. Discussions are really relevant to current events and I think 10\u2f10 would recommend this class.",
          "Typical NU english class. Prof Johnson is helpful and the books we read were interesting but everything discussed was pretty expected and I didn't feel like I learned anything groundbreaking.",
          "There were some days of interesting discussion in this class, however on the whole I was not a huge fan of the subject matter. Didn't have to do a ton of the readings to be able to participate. I did not think the assignments reflected the tone or discourse of the class at all, especially because the instructions for each assignment were so rigid but the grading was easy.",
          "\u2013",
          "This was such a good class!! The materials were really interesting and Professor Johnson was amazing! The work itself was not very challenging and the class discussions were interesting, definitely worth taking",
          "This class covered such interesting stories. I enjoyed nearly all of the materials we read, and I definitely see this class impacting my future literary career at Northwestern and beyond.",
          "Professor Johnson is wonderful! She is super helpful and kind. She really prioritizes supporting and engaging students. I recommend this class.",
          "People really do not know what intersectionality is! A hard class to take with wealthy, straight, white people!!",
          "The texts/materials in this course were very enjoyable, but I wasn't so sure they were all that interesting to talk about. The texts kind of speak for themselves, so class discussion seemed pretty relaxed and not super consequential, but it was nice that way. Professor Johnson does an amazing job at facilitating the class and is definitely a natural when it comes to being insightful, as well as letting students talk. Taking a class with her is worthwhile and I would do it again."

          "Stern is an amazing professor, but she expects a lot from students. If you don't realistically plan to read four Faulkner novels in one quarter, you're going to get left behind. But if you're jazzed about reading Faulkner, you'll get a ton out of this class.",
          "This class is a ton of reading - 4 Faulkner books in less than ten weeks is not an easy task. It's important to do the readings, as almost every class is a discussion. Prof Stern is a great professor. She is brilliant and really encouraging",
          "Every English major has said that you have to take this course before you graduate. I'm really glad I did. The course material is intellectually challenging (it is Faulkner) but extremely important. Definitely have to read all the material to enjoy or understand the discussion in class. This is not a class where you can expect to \"get by\" with skimming, because Prof. Stern wants everyone to talk and discuss (participation is 25%). There is only one 7-8 page final paper and two take-home exams in the course. The exams are close-reading so they're a bit tricky but are super manageable (i.e. take 1.5 hours) if you have taken really good notes all quarter.",
          "The number of readings can be overwhelming at times but if you try to set personal goals for when to have each book finished, you'll be okay (maybe try books on tape as well). Faulkner's writing can be very disorienting so take your time. Professor Stern is an absolutely fabulous professor, she knows a lot about Faulkner and the academic theories surrounding literature but she's also very open to hearing new interpretations from the students.",
          "This class is pretty tough but it's worth it; the novels are hard to get through but Professor Stern is incredible and the class discussions can be really interesting when people are engaged",
          "I love Professor Stern so much. Please take classes with her if you are an English major and if you aren't one then please take a class with her. She is brilliant and kind and funny and perceptive and just great. Also if you're into great literature but are scared about it this is the class to take.",
          "Faulkner is difficult and I didn't really have any idea what I was getting myself into. That said, I learned a lot and Prof. Stern is really really smart and cool. I would def recommend taking this class down the road in your English career, after you've taken quite a few classes and are really comfortable with discussion because I found this classroom particularly intimidating.",
          "I would have loved less discussion and more lecture-style teaching. Everything Prof. Stern had to say was great, and I would have liked to hear more of it.",
          "Lots of reading, but a really good class for English majors and minors. Prof. Stern is stern but great",
          "This course will definitely challenge you in so many ways. Faulkner feels almost impossible at times. But you learn so much from being thrown into his crazy world! Professor Stern is so passionate and she\u2019s great at helping you work through tough topics. A course that everyone will grow from!",
          "I took this class because I love Julia Stern, not because I had any interest in Faulkner. Honestly, Faulkner didn't grow on me much, but Professor Stern is so witty and intelligent that it made up for it. Honestly Professor Stern is one of my favorite English professors at Northwestern: she gets everyone involved in discussion, made me feel like what I was saying in class was insightful instead of stupid, and even had an end-of-the-year party at her house during our last class. It's worth taking the class just for her. Our TA Brad was also wonderful, since he was good at rephrasing some of the loftier concepts that we learned into something a little more understandable. They worked very well together and made the class a lot of fun, even if the reading material wasn't my favorite.",
          "Professor Stern's Faulkner class is an absolute Northwestern bucket list class!!!! Any English major (or person interested in reading fascinating and challenging novels) should do their very best to find time to take this class. Professor Stern is a brilliant teacher, with strong opinions on everything she teaches but also an openness and enthusiasm that encourages every student to create their own theories and ideas about these dense and amazing novels. A thing I really love about this class is that it prioritizes careful close-reading over anything else - there is very little work throughout the quarter other than reading and re-reading the novels, which allows you time to actually finish and think about all of the books. Highest praise!"

          "Honestly really really liked this course, the prof and TAs were great.",
          "This class is not easy if you have no previous knowledge of poetry. It is not an easy distro class.",
          "Great class, Gottlieb is a good lecturer and really wanted everyone to learn and enjoy the class.",
          "Class was challenging. Professor was great",
          "This class was so much fun! It's informative and will teach you about the structural aspects of poetry. The workload is light but challenges your skills in interpreting poetry.",
          "Not as easy as one might think!!!!!! Gottlieb is a phenomenal teacher though. The papers were graded pretty harshly..",
          "A pretty easy and good distro class. Not too much work and interesting material",
          "If you like reading poetry and have a genuine interest in it, this class is very engaging. Prof Gottlieb is super knowledgeable and passionate, and the TAs are wonderful. It is also relatively easy to do well if you go to discussion and keep up with the weekly assignments.",
          "I liked learning about poem analysis but there was a lot of busy work and pointless information",
          "I would only recommend taking this class if you like poetry, since if you don't it can get super dull",
          "Great, chill class! Professor and TAs are very nice and helpful, papers are interesting, and the final exam is very straightforward.",
          "Great class, taught me a lot of things about poetry without being unreasonaby challenging. Fairly straightforward, especially if you attend lectures. Professor is awesome and got us candy, and Jonas was an amazing TA and lots of fun to talk to outside of a class context.",
          "Lots of readings, which get to be hard to stay on top of, but a very enjoyable class. I learned a ton of new things and it was not too much of a challenge as many people take it for a distro. This class is a really fun chance to learn about poetry. Don't wait to the last minute to write papers!! And keep a running list of vocab words and definitions!",
          "I would recommend taking this course, although it was not what I envisioned going in, I still enjoyed it. 5% extra credit to your total grade for reciting a short poem and 5 easy ec points on the final. Good instruction and teacher certainly cares a lot an is enthusiastic. I reread some previous CTECS studying for the final and I don;t know what people are talking about. Really easy workload and if you care at all you should be able to get an A. Definitely take this class",
          "A pretty manageable course. A perfect amount of both reading and writing. I wish we were able to write more poetry and spend less time reading it. The class is not an easy A. Prof. Gottlieb selects a perfect variety or poems and is a great introduction to poetry. She is an entertaining lecturer, knows a lot about poetry and enthusiastic about the topic.",
          "The class was very repetitive. We did not cover all the poems we read during lecture or discussion which left blank spaces in the understanding of the poems and the course in general.",
          "I loved the course! I loved Professor Gottliebaand my TA was super chill and very helpful.",
          "THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE CLASSES AT NORTHWESTERN! Simply amazing. Not too much work, and all the assignments are engaging and rewarding. For people who have some degree of appreciation for any type of art, and are open to enjoying poetry, this class provides an opportunity to find great meaning in an entire art form, while not having to bust their backs to get a good grade. Nearly perfect course.",
          "I loved this class, if you listen to your TAs feedback on your paper you will do really well! I had a lot of fun analyzing poetry critically and it was a great distraction from the stress of STEM classes!",
          "The readings are interesting if you really like poetry. Keeping up with them is a good idea, but don't stress if you miss a poem or two.",
          "it is pointless, just an easy distro; barely learned anything, pretty easy to keep up with the minimal work. The TA's grade the papers harshly because they have a COMPLETELY different format for papers than regular writing courses so that kinda stinks, but still expecting an A",
          "decent distro, my TA made this class possible to survive.",
          "THis class was pretty solid. Professor Gottlieb is very enthusiastic about poetry which makes class fun. My only complaint is that I felt that a lot of times class was pretty unorganized and I would walk away from class without really knowing what I learned. Pretty solid class though if you need a fairly easy distro.",
          "It's a good class, and fairly easy. Take it if you're interested in poetry and looking for a distro.",
          "Prof Gottlieb is AWESOME and Jonas is a great TA. Take this class, you'll be able to understand poems if you put in some time and efforts!",
          "If you're looking for a distro please take this class!!",
          "This class has a reasonable workload. I personally found lectures to be kind of boring and I didn't feel that I learned a lot from it. However, I loved my discussion section and definitely got a deeper understanding of poetry from it",
          "You would be hard-pressed to find a more passionate professor of English, or indeed any other subject, than Professor Gottlieb. As you might imagine of a large introductory class, students were relatively unresponsive during lectures, but Gottlieb powered through with unbridled enthusiasm and good humor. If you actually put in the effort to do the weekly reading/writing exercises, you'll enjoy the class. TA office hours were extremely helpful when it came to fleshing out arguments for the two papers, and they graded relatively easily. The final was also simple as long as you kept up with the weekly reading, which didn't take long.",
          "Gottlieb is a great lecturer, I had never studied poetry before this class and frankly didn't like it all that much but I gained a ton of appreciation for it through this class. Great lit distro",
          "It was a lot harder than I thought it would be.",
          "Essays are a grind but going to class is fun and enjoyable. Lots of extra credit offered and as long as you take advantage of those opportunities you should get an A. Class is not necessary to attend. Discussion sections were pretty fun and enlightening.",
          "This course was really fun and easy; I enjoyed reading the poems.",
          "Pretty easy course, very interesting lecture, and fun class",
          "I went into this class with a feeling of frustration towards poetry, but now I truly feel more appreciative of poetry. The professor really helped me understand the intricacy of poetry and how beautiful it can be.",
          "Good class. Frustrating when you don't know how to analyze poems - it seems like something you're born with or not."

Professor Evans was a great teacher, but the lectures did not help at all with the exams, which made them seem arbitrary and unnecessary to attend. There was not a lot of homework except for the readings (which you can get away with not doing every week), and the papers assigned were pretty straightforward and easy.",

Personally, the worst part of this course was that they said they wanted your genuine analysis of the texts, but there was clearly a 'right answer' they were expecting, which was however the texts were analyzed in lecture. The midterm\u02ffinal are unnecessarily stressful and difficult to study for. That being said, the lectures were somewhat interesting and the professor seemed nice and is clearly passionate about the material (although it gets very dry at times).",
          "Lecture was AMAZING. Readings were sometimes dull but professor Evans made them interesting. The wide array of themes discussed in the course makes it very comprehensive",
          "unnecessarily difficult for a survey course",
          "I enjoyed reading different literature from the beginning of canon.However, most of the first part of the class is boring religious crap.",
          "As far as basic major requirements go, this course was pretty entertaining and gives a good overview of early British lit. I wish I had taken this earlier.",
          "You learn as much as you put in, and it's very easy to put in nothing.",
          "Pretty easy class - do the readings, show up to lecture, and the texts are broken down in an easy to understand way.",
          "The lectures are pretty dull at times, but the course was pretty straight forward and easy if you kept up with the readings.",
          "This class is pretty fun the texts are interesting after the medieval period. SO if you can get through that then it is pretty good. I honestly think this is better than 210-2 but thats just a personal opinion. I would say do not take it for a distro because there are more fun less intense English classes for that. There were only two papers two tests and weekly discussion questions. Professor Evans and TAs are great.",
          "Decent class, there's a lot of reading, but exams themselves aren't that difficult.",
          "This class was underwhelming. Most of the texts we read, especially in the latter half of the course, were engaging, but the lectures gave too little time and analysis to each text. Professor Evans was a good communicator of ideas, but a lot of the times, it was difficult to see the relevance of some of her lectures. We would focus on the cultural context for half of the class, and then went into surface-level literary analysis for a short period of time before moving on to the next text. Then, when it was time for us to write our essays, it felt like I could've written the exact same essays I wrote without attending the lectures. My TA, Clay, made this class much better than it would've been. He led our discussions very well, and made clear to us that he was there to help us and improve our writing. He was very flexible with meeting one-on-one, and I learned a lot about my writing from him.",
          "Prof. Evans is an enthusiastic and clearly knowledgeable professor, but the way the course is taught is somewhat misguided. The lecture focuses too much on historical context and not enough on analysis of the text, making it easy not to read before class. Evans relies on a question-answer approach that simply isn't too effective in a larger lecture class.",
          "This course was very enjoyable. We read a lot of very different texts, stating with middle english and transitioning to sonnets and lyrical poetry. It covered a lot of material, but didn't feel extremely rushed. Professor Evans was amazing!",
          "This course was solid. The readings are not the most interesting but Prof. Evans is a good lecturer and is very willing to help in and out of class. She looks to add discussion to even a large lecture and genuinely cares about the class. She models the close reading she looks for in tests and essays.",
          "It was okay",
          "Not the worst English class but not the best. Lots of poetry. Make sure you do the readings throughout because then you'll probably be in good shape for the tests."

She organizes the course and assignments with too many tricks here and there - they felt like pointless obstructions to learning the material. If you have to take it with her, try and focus on the texts you're reading. Most of them are pretty great, and focusing on the texts will get you through.",

          "This is a great course if you're interested in British literature, and a fine course if you're not interested in British literature. The beginning is somewhat difficult, as the readings are in Middle English and no matter how easy the professor makes it seem, Middle English is near impossible to decipher. You're better off just looking up summaries of the text rather than trying to read it. The texts in the middle and end of the course are fantastic and definitely worth rereading on your own time.",
          "For a class that is required to complete the literature major/minor, English 210-1 is not a bad course. It's fairly easy, the professor (Kasey Evans) is engaging and passionate about the material, and the lecture and discussion style means you can get a good grade while putting in a not too overwhelming amount of effort. However, I would not recommend taking this course if you're not required to do so. Most of these texts are boring, and as a survey of English lit, this class doesn't allow for a lot of personal engagement and critical thought. The English department has so much to offer, but this course feels restrictive in its scope.",
          "Great course! Would take even if it weren't required for my major. Professor Evans maintains student focus throughout lecture. Do the weekly reading quizzes (they're for comprehension, not analysis), and the rest of the class will feel like a breeze. Just don't fall behind on the reading, and you'll do fine. Professor Evans chooses her texts thoughtfully so you're not having to read hundreds of pages for each class rather sonnets, poems, short stories, and specific sections of longer stories).

She does a really nice job highlighting what's important about each text and explaining the nitty gritty, while also giving you a good idea of the big picture and how everything connects thematically.",

Discussion section was very helpful, and the TAs are a great resource for writing your final papers, or just getting general help. Lecture is interesting, but very busy - the professor does not post notes to Canvas so it's a frantic mess to write down everything she has to say. The quizzes are VERY specific, and require an in-depth reading of the text, despite the professor's claim that those who read will have no trouble. The grade is distributed among quizzes, participation in discussion, a midterm, a final paper, and a final (opting out is an option if you score over 90% on the quizzes).",

          "Professor Law gave interesting and intriguing lectures, and I looked forward to attending his lectures. He was very passionate about the novels that we read which made the lectures more fun and enjoyable.",
          "It was a decent course! Very similar to AP English classes so if you excelled there, this class will be fine. There's a quite a bit of reading assigned but there's only one midterm, one paper, and one final (choose either a paper or sit-down final). Jules Law is a good professor and his lectures are usually pretty interesting, it was a good course esp if you're looking for an english distro.",
          "The course was highly interesting, not too time-consuming, and Professor Law never went the full hour and 20 minutes (something I respect, as opposed to those professors who feel the need to draw out their class superfluously).",
          "The class itself was very much what you make of it. As someone who went to lecture half of the time, I felt like I was able to follow along, but I obviously did not get the full experience and analytical interpretation that other people did who paid attention in lecture. It's very easy to follow along as Professor Law provides a lot of good critical analysis that you can understand if you read a quick summary on Sparknotes. The grading is very fair for the amount of work you put in. Overall, I\u027d say it's a good distro to take if you need one.",
          "Prof. Law is a genius and had so many insightful things to say that I never would've considered had it not been for him and his ideas. He made me realize that every single thing can be analyzed which is overwhelming but exciting to learn. Nothing is too much of a reach for him. Reading isn't terrible at all, you just have to keep up with it. It sucks that you have to do a midterm exam and paper, but the choice is yours during the finals. Take this course!",
          "Intro to Fiction with Law is pretty decent. Not only does he have great music taste, he really presents different types of theories and challenges you to do the same. For the midterm, you take a written exam and submit a paper and for the final, you get the choice of going for either one.",
          "This class has a lot of reading but it's interesting and not overwhelming. 213 is well taught.",
          "This class was too big for a literature course, as student interpretations and ideas were not offered or discussed. The books we had to read were chosen well and the concepts the professor introduced were thought-provoking and very interesting. The testing methods did not really reflect our knowledge of the course, but they were clear and the instructions were easy-to-follow.",
          "Overall solid distro. Professor Law is funny and engaging though class can get boring sometimes. One midterm, one 5 page short paper, and then choice between final\u02f5 page final paper. We read 4 books and it was cool to not have a problem set for once.",
          "Professor Law is extremely intelligent and will really make you think! Easy A if you read the books.",
          "Introduction to Fiction does involve heavy reading since there are four novels that must be read during the quarter. The novels are brilliant, the lectures cover the majority of what the reading assignment was assigned. The discussion sections helped me and other students talk about the novel more depth. Overall, this is a really good course to take for those who are interested in classic novels.",
          "Jules is full of energy and is a great lecturer but when you're not as interested in the material, like me, then it's a little hard to stay focused for the whole lecture. The class wasn't too bad, we just read four books, took a midterm exam, wrote a midterm paper, and got to decide between a paper or an exam for the final. I\u027d recommend for a lit distro.",
          "Pretty chill class -- lots of reading, but Jules is an incredible lecturer, so going to class is legitimately enjoyable. Easy midterm, and then two moderately challenging papers, but it's super helpful going to TA office hours.",
          "I thought this course was pretty easy. You aren't really held accountable for the readings so you either do it or you don't. The lectures were interesting, and Professor Law is pretty engaging, but it will not help you be a better reader or a better analyzer of literary text.",
          "This class is a great class to take if you're looking for something that won't be too challenging but will be interesting. The reading took up some time, but the books are generally short and don't require a lot of effort to understand them. The papers aren't bad either -- just make sure to know how to write a paper and go to office hours if you're confused at all. Overall a very enjoyable class and attendance at lecture was optional.",
          "I was excited to read the books, but the class went so quickly that reading and understanding all four texts seemed impossible. The lecture's were hard to follow, but discussion was very helpful.",
          "The lectures for this class were so fun and interesting. I actually wish I had a few of them recorded to listen to again. My discussion section started out pretty slow but was interesting and engaging by the end of the quarter. The only problem I had was falling behind on the reading. For the big lectures, it really seems like its not important to read because there's no evidence of whether you did or not, but when papers come around you realize it is.",
          "Good course. Readings were interesting. Not difficult. Lectures were a little strange - Law often offered perspectives that were intriguing but ultimately didn't make sense or didn't seem that relevant.",
          "This class is a great distribution requirement class to take. There's only a midterm, a paper, and for the final you can choose between a paper or an exam. It was very difficult to keep up with the readings while taking other classes, and honestly I did not read every book, but when you could read the books they were interesting and you still learn a lot just by coming to lecture. Jules Law has a great teaching style and made lectures interesting.",
          "Typical Lit distro. Not necessarily an easy A but the books aren't bad.",
          "Alright class. Good for distro.",
          "I enjoyed the lectures and readings for this class, but it was a lot of reading every week. I was never caught up after week one, and it was really overwhelming.",
          "Overall thought this course was fairly interesting and not a bad distro to take, but it is a lot of reading.",
          "There is quite a bit of reading, but it's tolerable because it's fiction. I liked the books we read. Professor Law is a cool guy. Lectures and discussion sections are enjoyable.",
          "This course provided riveting interpretations of amazing texts without overwhelming you with too much reading or writing.",
          "I got by in this course without finishing any of the novels (or even starting one of them). I believe this course to be more than achievable if you have upper-level English experience under your belt.",
          "The lectures did not make much sense to me. The professor often went on tangents and did not connect topics. The class is definitely not an easy A as had been expected. Would not recommend.",
          "I didn't always keep up with the readings, which made the discussions more challenging -- they expect active participation. The readings were interesting, and I was able to consider them as reading for pleasure rather than for school work.",
          "Great distribution requirement - a lot of reading but evaluations are straightforward and fair.",
          "Overall this is a really easy class, I didn't read any of the books in this class and the exams and papers still weren't very hard at all. Lectures aren't necessary to attend.",
          "I love the books in this course!! Especially Mrs. Dalloway; Virginia Woolf is my #1. Jules Law is a very nice, helpful guy, but I found lectures to be kind of a drag\u02fboring. He let us out early, but it still felt super long.",
          "This is a decent course if you need a distro. Even though it's scheduled for an hour and twenty minutes twice a week, he always let us go after 50 minutes. If you play your cards right you don't have to read all the books and you can skip every lecture after the first midterm. Jules is passionate about his subject, and follows the \"English Professor\" stereotype pretty closely. There are no small assignments so if you fail one exam/ paper you're pretty much screwed, so you need to study the right material, but no more. The TA sections were actually fun but unnecessary. This class is just very average, and will probably be one I don't remember taking in a couple years.",
          "If you enjoy reading at all this class will be very easy and enjoyable. Probably on the same difficulty level if not a bit easier than AP Lang/Lit. Focus on improving reading and writing skills so grading is not incredibly harsh.",
          "It depends on what you like. The lectures were mostly just, as a lecture is, being talked at for about an hour. The ideas Professor Law introduced were interesting, and the outside sources used in lecture worked well with the course, but there was little stimulation in the lectures themselves. The discussion was my favorite part, as it gave me an opportunity to analyze the readings myself. It was quite a bit of reading before each class, but nothing too hard.",
          "The course is graded on the midterm, an essay, and a final exam\u02fessay (you get to choose). The midterm isn't that difficult, and you get to choose the topic of the first essay. The final exam is designed to be easier for students who aren't English majors, but if you decide to do the essay, you have to choose from a selection of prompts, and it's graded harder than the first essay.",
          "GREAT CLASS. Novels were super, and even though I had read several before the course, Professor Law discussed them in ways that were completely new and fascinating. Not at all heavy workload, one midterm and a midterm paper, and the final (either written final or a final paper). Discussion sections really help expand on topics in class and TAs are helpful with paper writing. Love this class",
          "You do not have to read the books to get an A in this class",
          "A lot of reading. You can't fall behind.",
          "I really enjoyed this class. It is a lot of reading but Jules Law is very good. Lectures can get a little boring. The TA is awesome",
          "The best English class I took at northwestern",
          "There;s a lo of reading involved but if you stay on top of it you're fine.",
          "I liked that this course gave me a new perspective on classic novels, a few of which I had read before.",
          "Lots and lots of reading in a very short amount of time, but the books are all classics-- we read Frankenstein, Dracula, Mrs. Dalloway, and Jane Eyre-- and very easy to read. Overall a really good distortion course if you enjoy reading classics or literary analysis.",
          "This course is not too much work and it a great class. The books are pretty good and Professor Law is great at teaching them.",
          "Jules Law is AMAZING. great enlish distro if you like reading British classics and professors who play bomb music at the beginning of class. We read Jane Eyre, Frankenstein, Mrs. Dalloway, and Dracula. 1 midterm, 1 paper, and you get to choose b/w a final and a paper for the end (most people choose paper). if you do the readings and put effort into the paper, you can get the A",
          "Quite disappointing - the lectures were irrelevant and unnecessary to get a good grade.",
          "The course is good. It's not challenging if you keep up with the readings. I did not go to lecture for an entire month and I'm finishing with a great grade. If you read, and go to discussion, you will be fine.",
          "I really enjoyed lectures and discussion sections, however the amount of reading that we were expected to complete for each class was often overwhelming to the point where even when I wanted to stay caught up and read before each lecture, it wasn't possible to read over a 100 pages in-between each class, especially in-between a tuesday and a thursday. The books were really interesting though and Law was a great professor, so overall I am happy I took this class.",
          "I took this class as a distro (I'm a science major) and it was alright. It was A LOT of reading. I had already read two of the novels covered this year and only reread relevant parts of them for this class. There was one paper this year, and a midterm, and the choice between a final and a final paper. I took the final, and it was fair and a reasonable length.",
          "I enjoyed the readings. The discussions were engaging. The lectures were best when concerning Dracula.",
          "This is a decent distro. A little heavy on reading, somewhere between 50-100 pages every 2-3 days. As long as you do the reading however, the course is not that difficult. Professor Law's lectures definitely help in writing the midterm paper and final paper.",
          "Professor Locke was an awesome lecturer. He introduced very interesting interpretations of the novels we read, and taking this class has taught me how to see the novels from a different angle.",
          "Not a bad english bistro, a lot of reading though but you can get by without doing all of it",
          "n\u02fa",
          "I think it should this course should be a seminar. If youre going to talk about ways one COULD interpret a text, you might as well have a discussion about how people considered the text. But it wasn't, so I didn't like it.",
          "Really enjoyable class, texts, and discussion sections. Professor Law is an engaging lecturer who definitely opened my eyes to parts of the books that I might not have noticed otherwise. The exams and papers are fair, and you have a choice between a final paper or taking a final exam, which was nice.",
          "This was a great course, and Professor Law is the best! He is so passionate, and he had some really interesting and unique insights into the novels we read. Fairly minimal work (only a midterm, a paper, and a final), and lectures were so interesting and entertaining. Not usually an English person, but I loved this class!",
          "A fun class to take as a lit distro! Professor Law has a lot of great insights on the novels and the books you read are pretty interesting!",
          "This course was very boring. The lectures were very slow and too long. There is a lot of reading that can build up if you do not stay on task. Easy class that you can get an A on without even attending lectures.",
          "This course is a good intro English course. Not too hard, but you do have to read and think about the text critically in order to do well. Discussion sections are really helpful so make sure you go to them.",
          "It was a good course. Obviously a lot of reading. The essays aren't bad and lecture isn't required.",
          "The reading load seems like a lot, but as long as you keep on track with the schedule it's fine. The lectures, however, aren't that necessary since most of the times it feels as if Professor Law goes off track.",
          "This course is okay for a distro, but the books are not particularly great choices in my opinion and the instruction becomes fixated on aspects of the book I didn't find particularly relevant or interesting. the concepts are also not typical rhetorical devices so be ready for that",
          "I thought this course was okay. Only two of the novels I really liked. Lectures focused on really random parts of the novels that I didn't find important and discussions were not very intriguing.",
          "This class had a relatively low work load, even though at times it was a lot of reading. But overall, it was a good distro to take; if you meet with your TA a lot and keep up with the reading and work, it should be relatively easy.",
          "I loved this class! Jules is a great lecturer and the books were amazing.",
          "This a fine distribution course, and while there's a lot of reading it's not difficult and most of it is pretty interesting. The lectures are really boring and uninformative, as it's mostly the professor rambling on about his personal opinions and interpretations.",
          "Great class. Prof Law is amazing and so engaging. Would recommend to anyone who likes to read and needs a distro. Do not be intimidated if you are a non-English major- the TAs and Prof Law make the class doable for everyone.",
          "I loved the novels we read although it was sort of hard to keep up with the reading.",
          "This course was really interesting and not too bad workload wise. Great reading selection and Professor Law is really awesome.",
          "I loved the lectures and their central themes. It wasn't like I went to class and felt like I wasted my time reading. Each lecture connected to the reading due that day and made me think more deeply about the novel and its underlying themes.",
          "Overall solid distro class, lots of reading (which you only have to do for the first half of the class since there is a final paper or final exam). Professor Law is a good lecturer.",
          "Good class. The exams sometimes feel like they're designed to trick you though especially with quote matching similar texts.",
          "Good class! Reading is kind of a lot, but books you should probably read anyways. TAs were so chill, and only 1-2 papers which were pretty straightforward.",
          "A lot of reading. So much reading. Lecture can be very boring though if you don't keep up.",
          "I was excited to analyze texts, but we did not do so, even in discussion.",
          "This isn't a bad distro if you're willing to read the books and go to lecture.",
          "Prof. Law's presentations are a bit dry. Discussion sections are what promotes conversation about the novel.",
          "The class was good. Jules Law is an engaging professor although sometimes he can get boring and repeat himself. The notes you take give you everything you need for the paper but the exam was rough.",
          "Fun class, pretty easy, Law is awesome",
          "Easy class - you don't need to go to lecture to get a good grade (although discussion sections are mandatory and important). I found the readings interesting but the lectures drab. Learned more about the books in question but not really any particular skills.",
          "This was a GREAT class. 10\u2f10 recommend. Prof. Law is a great lecturer and his lectures are interesting and provide a whole new way to view the novels. It was never dull or boring and he went 20 min short every day for lecture, so getting out early was a major plus. The midterm reflected information that he had talked about and reading the books wasn't necessary but it made the class a lot more interesting when you actually knew what he was talking about.",
          "Jules Law was so interesting and really knew his material and was a very passionate lecturer. It was very interesting and the books we read were fantastic.",
          "I actually really enjoyed this course. However, it IS a lot of reading per week, so be prepared to devote a chunk of your time to reading novels. Despite this, the novels are interesting, so it's not too bad dedicating a ton of time.",
          "Started off strong : first two books were well explained and I learnt a lot from them. Second two were kind of rushed and there was no real incentive to read them or go to lecture.",
          "This class has A LOT of reading. In order to prepare for exams, you need to read the books because the spark notes can only do so much in terms of getting you ready for the quote identification and the mini essays. You can get away with not reading the books for the midterm paper and the final paper - but you've got to be really good at skimming and finding quotes and coming up with an argument. Lectures are a waste of time",
          "This course was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Northwestern. Professor Law is amazing and very insightful, and I loved going to his lectures because he would always highlight certain themes and passages in the text that I would not have focused on by myself. The assigned novels were all enjoyable to read, even though it can feel fast-paced because we usually had to read over 100 pages each week. I highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in reading fiction, even if it's not for a distribution or major/minor requirement.",
          "I thought this class was a really great intro literature class, and the level was set appropriately. Definitely take it if you're looking for an easy distro. 1 midterm paper 3-4 pgs, 1 midterm exam, and a final paper OR final exam. Books are normally pretty entertaining.",
          "I recommend this class. You're evaluated on discussion sections, a midterm, and two essays. The lectures were not really necessary to do well on the papers, but they were very interesting.",
          "Take a class with Professor Law, he's amazing!! such fun and engaging lectures, the readings are fascinating (albeit he could do a better job distributing the number of pages to read), and the midterm exam was very straightforward as were the papers. Highly recommend a class with Professor Law, and I very much enjoyed his course",
          "okay class. fairly low workload but there is a lot of reading. not an easy A",
          "The texts that we read were very interesting and the professor was really into explaining the texts to us, but It takes a lot of time to read. The number of pages you have to read nightly gets slightly excessive but it's also what one signs up for and should expect when taking the class. It's definitely a class that makes you have to think hard because the questions TA's ask you in discussion are challenging and makes you really have to analyze the text. Overall it's a class that isn't hard if you want to fulfill your literature requirement. I really enjoyed Professor Law's way of teaching.",
          "Ok class, sometimes it's tough for him to connect some really good points with larger themes.",
          "I really enjoyed the readings and instruction for this class. Overall it was a really good class, though I think a lot of my enjoyment of it stems from the fact that it's a topic I am passionate about anyway."

          "One of the most rewarding experiences I've had at Northwestern, great if you put the time in",
          "TAKE THIS CLASS. It's not the easiest english distro ever but it's definitely the most interesting. Davis is great and you learn so much from his lectures because he really does care about his students. The quizzes were really straightforward and you have a lot of freedom on the papers to choose a movie you want to write about",
          "This course is fun and interesting!",
          "This class is amazing! Professor Davis is great and you will learn so much from this class.",
          "Nick Davis was a great lecturer, and the class was very easy. However, having an awful TA really ruined this class for me.",
          "This class is amazing! I had just dropped a RTVF course and found exactly what I was looking for in this class. Professor Davis is the absolute best both as a lecturer and a person.",
          "Do yourself a favor and take this class if you have any interest in film. One of the best I've taken at NU. Professor Davis is an eloquent, knowledgeable, kind-hearted professor who will open your eyes to the nuances of the cinematic art form. Truly amazing.",
          "This course was great! Professor Davis is really passionate about films and the movies he picked to analyze were all really interesting and fun to take apart and analyze. The literature in the class was also interesting, some of it was really challenging to understand, but Professor Davis always explained it better in class. This course really pushed my literary analytical skills, my writing skills, and my understanding of film terminology. I will never watch movies the same again. Highly recommend this class!",
          "Davis is a treasure. He is, unfortunately, an all too rare occurrence here as an undergrad. I deeply enjoyed this class. Davis cares about his students, and he cares about the material. Take this class.",
          "This course is great if you enjoy movies. There are three quizzes that test your knowledge of the films, texts, and lecture content discussed, so make sure you keep up with everything. There are also two short assignments and two longer essays, including a discussion section. Overall, you have to put in work to do well in this class, but it's well worth it.",
          "Great course! I've always enjoyed film but got the vocabulary to understand the formal elements in a way I did not before. Also a great way to challenge critical thinking with comparisons between literary text and films. Not too much work, and easy quizzes!",
          "I loved this class, one of the best I've taken this year. I learned a lot about film. The lectures were super interesting and I looked forward to going to every single one.",
          "\u2013Hard ass class. Essays were impossible to write. Jesus christ I don't even know where to start. Professor Davis is a good man and passionate about teaching, but he can be very dull in class. I feel like he's immersed in his own world of literature than really lecturing to students.",
          "A lot of work, only take it if you're really interested in film/reading.",
          "Professor Davis is an excellent instructor and is very committed to the learning of his students. I gained a lot of skill in not just analyzing film, but also text. I am a senior, but had I taken a class like this sooner in my undergraduate career, I would have seriously considered getting an English minor. I also liked the emphasis on film that was produced within the last year.",
          "Great class!! The lectures can be a bit boring but you learn so much!! Not easy though",
          "The films we watched were great and Professor Davis is the absolute best.",
          "prof. davis is amazing and really passionate about this class. the workload of the class was spread out nicely but still requires you to do the reading and watch the films to participate in discussion section. the lectures are really engaging and i learned a lot.",
          "Cool and interesting because of the films we got to watch and because Nick Davis is awesome, but my TA was a harsh grader so this was not an easy A.",
          "everything",
          "take this class! nick davis knows SO MUCH and is a WONDERFUL professor. if you do the readings, watch the films, and attend lecture, you'll be right on track to get an A. the quizzes are great tools to show what you know and make sure that you're keeping up",
          "It was a cool course with interesting subject matter that was fun to learn about. Professor Davis is great at talking about both film and literature and does a good job at making the lectures engaging.",
          "Discussion sections with my TA allowed for a more intimate setting in which I felt most comfortable to discuss readings.",
          "THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT NORTHWESTERN. Nick Davis is an incredibly intelligent and engaging lecturer and my TA was knowledgeable and helpful in providing a lot of productive feedback. The work load may seem like a lot but if you plan carefully it shouldn't be that bad. I am an extremely slow reader and for the most part most of the readings/movies that I had to read/watch went by super quickly because most assignments are very entertaining. 10000\u2f10 would take again!",
          "This class is amazing! Professor Davis is not only one of the most personable, enthusiastic, genuinely sweet professors at Northwestern, but listening to him lecture about film is like having a conversation over coffee with someone who knows basically everything. He presents ways of thinking about film rather than things to think about certain films; encourages students to have intellectual dialogues not only with each other but in their own heads; and manages, somehow, to be simultaneously incredibly academic about what he is teaching and also so much fun to listen to.",
          "This class is AMAZING!!EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE THIS CLASS!! Professor Davis is the best and really changes the way you approach watching movies and understand how some of the choices into making the movie change how you watch it. Also really interesting to see how movies adapts its text and the different choices that were used to reflect the same meaning in the text. It is a good amount of work; reading a book/short story and watching a movie for every week and gets more intense towards the end of the quarter. There are also only two papers and 2 smaller assignments throughout the quarter.",
          "I learned a lot in this course and it greatly challenged my thoughts on film. The course was a lot of work and difficult, but resulted in much learning.",
          "I looooooved this class! Professor Davis is an amazing lecturer and cares about his students and the materials. The TAs are great, and the assessments are good measurement of what you're learning. It takes time to do the readings and watch the movies, but they're all interesting and make for good conversations and papers. Take this class if you like movies or literature!",
          "Really liked most of the movies and books we read. Loved hearing Professor Davis's thoughts and insights",
          "I really enjoyed the days when we talked about the film and the book together. Those, to me, were the most rewarding and interesting.",
          "It was a good class and I learned a lot",
          "It's a fun class- go to lectures, Davis is a fun guy. It's a lot of work because you have to watch at least a movie and a couple of short books a week, and the grading can be somewhat strict. Take if you're a good writer and you like movies.",
          "This will be the best class you ever take during your time at NU! Take it with Prof. Davis he's so passionate about the material and the students themselves that going to lecture is an eye opening experience every time you go. This was a 9:30 and I was pumped to go every time, don't expect an easy A though, you'll have to work for it but it's so worth it.",
          "I am now aware of many film techniques that is very useful in daily lives.",
          "This is a great distro, not easy but worth it! Davis is absolutely amazing and makes the class really meaningful.",
          "Very good distro. Fun class with good reading, writing, and movie watching assignments. Professor Davis is great.",
          "This is a really interesting class, but is definitely not easy. The readings really pile up quickly and it can become really easy to fall behind. If you have the time to commit to this class, you should take it because Davis is great, otherwise it will turn into a hassle.",
          "Really great course, Davis is knowledgeable and an incredible lecturer.",
          "This class was amazing. It is time consuming because you have to watch movies that are 2 to 3 hours long as well as different reading material like novels, short stories, plays, and essays. But if you commit to doing all of the homework the distro is rather easy and enjoyable. The movies included vary from black and white to recent Oscar winners. The professor makes the lecture enjoyable. I would recommend going to all the lectures becasue despite the slides being on the canvas website you will miss things if you dont go.",
          "Professor Davis is great and provides tons of insight on the films in the class. Very good literature\u02ffine arts disto, limited reading.",
          "Davis is one of the best professors I've ever had, both in how he lectures and how he interacts with students. He's super accessible, incredibly nice, super committed (he Skyped into class the day after a surgery so that he could give us important info himself), and SO KNOWLEDGABLE. Make sure you have enough time in your schedule to spend time with the movies and the texts in this class because they're awesome and it sucks when you have to miss content because you don't have time. But take this class.",
          "NOT AN EASY A. WITH THAT SAID, YOU LEARN SO MUCH IN THIS CLASS. PROFESSOR DAVIS IS AN OUTSTANDING LECTURER AND HAS CLEARLY PUT MUCH TIME AND THOUGHT INTO THIS COURSE. HE ALSO LEARNS NAMES REALLY WELL WHICH IS REALLY IMPRESSIVE.",
          "This course is phenomenal. I love films and writing and this course brought both of those elements together. I have never learned so much about the making and the details of and in a film before. Watching fantastic movies and reading their texts and discussing them is amazing and with a professor and TA's and students who are engaged into it as well is awesome. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND and encourage everyone to take this course because it was fun, challenging, and opens your eyes to the world of film in a new way I never saw before.",
          "SUCH AN AWESOME COURSE!!!!!!! Take it take it take it. At first it may seem like a lot of work but it was very doable and most of the work is watching movies. Professor Davis is amazing, his lectures are exciting, he's funny and truly teaches you to analyze film even if this is the first film-related class you take. Maria is the best TA!!!!",
          "This class was amazing. It helped me analyze film and its literature(s) at a spectacular level. Nick Davis is an awesome professor and he knows a lot about what he teaches.",
          "The course covered an array of films, exposing me to styles and techniques I had not heard of before, even with films I\u027d already seen. I will not look at cinema the same way again.",
          "i don't know, i thought this class was okay. i took it because a lot of my friends raved about it, but i think film just isn't really for me. i think if you know you're interested in film though, you\u027d probably really enjoy it.",
          "Great class!",
          "Prof. Davis is amazing and the subject matter was really interesting. I got to see a lot of amazing movies and read the texts that they were adapted from. I really was able to look at film with a new eye by the end of the quarter.",
          "Take this class! It is super interesting and you'll watch some great movies and texts you never would have been exposed to. Grading not too harsh. Prof is very nice with the quizzes, tells you when they're going to be and the questions weren't bad at all.",
          "Proffesor Davis is amazing and this course is amazing. I am a stem guy and I still really resonated with this course. It somehow finds a way to engage deep social issues in the context of directorial work, and you really always will have something to talk about. I\u027d say the hardest part is actually watching the movies on time-- a three hour film can be surprisingly long the night before a 9am class-- but if you aren't the procrastinator type then this class should be all fun all quarter."

Overall- i learned a lot and became very familiar with the bible, especially the old testament but the reading has a lot of characters and different stories and to do well you have to keep up with the reading.",
          "This is definitely a great course! For a lit. and fine arts distro, it was actually extremely manageable. Easy A in my opinion as long as you do all of the work. Anad not to mention, the material is both incredibly interesting and prof newman makes it easy to follow along in class. Toally recommend taking this class!!",
          "As someone who is not at all religious, I absolutely adored this course. I learned so much about the text of arguably the most important and influential book in western history and for that I'm grateful. Even more, this course was taught in a non-religious way, focusing more on the literary aspects of the Bible which I found fascinating, especially in our analysis of the Bible and potential future application of its key themes and ideas in creative writing. Anyone at all interested in reading/writing should take this course.",
          "This class was great. Though the Bible can be a lot of reading, it was spaced quite well and lectures made the material worth reading. Prof. Newman is incredibly insightful. Also, the class is not too heavy in outside work, as there are weekly Canvas posts, one 5 page essay, and 4 quizzes in section over basic terms. Highly recommend.",
          "would recommend to take regardless of religious opinion\ud87e\udfackground. great lectures. not too demanding, but do the readings. will get a lot out of class",
          "This was probably one of my favorite distribution classes so far. The discussion sections, writing assignments, and lectures were all engaging and provided an excellent platform to engage the biblical text.",
          "I really liked this class, but some of the grading was a bit tough, especially because I am a poor writer.",
          "Professor Newman is absolutely phenomenal. Best professor I have ever had and best course I have taken so far at Northwestern.",
          "Everyone should take this class. It was honestly one of the best courses I've taken at NU. Whether you've never opened a Bible or are very familiar with it, you'll learn a lot about it as a sophisticated work of literature. Prof Newman is a phenomenal lecturer. The workload is very minimal.",
          "This course was interesting and pretty easy to follow. However, I expected it to be an easy A distribution requirement but it was not.... I think the teachers were trying to make it seem more intense than it is, so they were not just handing out A's, even though I put in the necessary amount of work.",
          "I wanted to gain a basic understanding of the fundamental text, and I feel Professor Newman\u2019s class helped me sufficiently gain that exposure and more. The quizzes were difficult, and often called upon students to recall (what I believed to be) obscure\u02fesoteric characters of themes. Blog posts and the 5-page essay allowed for sufficient grade-padding, though.",
          "I loved this course! It was very interesting and fun, and the instructor, Barbara is amazing!",
          "Professor Newman is INCREDIBLE. I cannot recommend this class highly enough. I came in with no prior information about the Bible and throughout the quarter I could not stop talking about this course. She made a book that can be difficult to read something that I loved doing the reading for. I wish this class was a series so I could keep learning. I usually shy away from 3x a week classes, but I honestly wish I had more time to analyze all of these readings because I always learned something new!!",
          "Great distro. Totally doable and honestly incredibly interesting even if you have no background or previous interest in the subject. Newman is phenomenal.",
          "Great class, lectures very informative. TA sessions are super awesome and helpful. Make sure to do the readings to do well on quizzes. Take this class.",
          "I loved this class. Professor Newman's lecture style is very engaging and entertaining, and she makes the text easy to understand. I went into this class hoping to get a basic understanding of the Bible so I can recognize references to it in other texts and pop culture (and to be able to refute ignorant Bible-based political arguments), and I definitely got that!",
          "This is an amazing class! Lectures are engaging and interesting. Prof Newman is incredible, so knowledgeable and a great lecturer. Minimal writing (250-word reflections every week) and one five-page paper. Not a ton of work, totally worth it for a lit distro!",
          "super cool class, not too tough, especially if you have some background on the bible. prof. newman is the coolest, very knowledgable and funny.",
          "This course was FANTASTIC. I came in with mild interest in the Bible and am now in awe of it. It's rigorous and Prof. Newman expects and deserves a lot of your effort. None of the assignments felt like busywork, though. I recommend going to office hours; she's super helpful and interesting!",
          "It was pretty easy and an interesting topic, Newman is wild but in a good way.",
          "This course blew me out of the water. I'm not a religious person but have always had an interest in studying the literary trends in the bible, and what I got was somewhat of an english, philosophy, and writing class all in one",
          "Take this class with Newman! She is fascinating and presents the material in really interesting ways. I have ADHD and have trouble paying attention in lectures, let alone lectures that don't use slides, but she kept things engaging. Also her wardrobe is iconic. It was really interesting to look at the Bible in a literary way as opposed to a religious way. The effect was incredibly unifying in a class of students from diverse religious backgrounds. Overall, amazing class, would recommend.",
          "This was a really interesting course, not only is the subject matter fascinating, but Professor Newman is incredibly knowledgeable and engaging in her lecture style. There are no tests, just seven short (250-300 word) responses and one 5-page essay, which are graded very fairly. As long as you read the bible and pay attention in class, it's not too difficult of a class.",
          "I loved reading about different genres because I didn't think there were any funny stories",
          "I loved this course!! Professor Newman is very nice and a great lecturer. I had some prior familiarity with the Bible (which is absolutely not necessary to take this course!!) and this class gave me a whole new perspective on the text. It was very fascinating. Also, the workload is extremely manageable and is spread out very evenly throughout the quarter so you never feel overwhelmed. Great distro!!",
          "This is a great course to take if you're trying to fulfill an ethics distribution requirement. Professor Newman brings to light a lot of interesting aspects of the Bible, and the course itself is not a lot of work, as you only have to write a weekly paragraph response and a 5 page paper for the class.",
          "TAKE THIS CLASS. I don't even know where to start. Professor Newman is wild, fun, and unbelievably knowledgable. She delivers really interesting and thorough lectures, assigns great materials, and is generally a very fun person. You definitely never get bored in her class. I had zero religious knowledge coming into the class, and that was perfectly fine. In fact, I think it's worth taking both for people with no knowledge of the Bible, and those who have studied the Bible from a Christian perspective, because Newman offers a number of interpretations. Everyone can get something out of her lectures. ALSO, HUGE bonus, there is no final or midterm. There's just a short five page paper, weekly written responses, and a number of quizzes. There is quite a bit of reading though, and it's easy to get behind on it if you have a lot going on."

          "Lots of short in class quizzes on Gabel. She grades papers pretty hard but the midterm was not hard. Textbook is pretty critical of the Bible, claimed to evaluate it as literature but is pretty biased and makes a lot of assumptions that we carried over in class and just assumed to be true. Not a great class to take if you are looking to develop your faith/look into the Bible in any context besides a critical one.",
          "I thought this class was very boring. I kept wishing I had dropped it early on. It wasn't poorly taught but I felt like class was repetitive and boring. It felt like being back in a high school class, we had group worksheets most days. I feel like I didn't come away with improved critical reading or writing skills. It wasn't a difficult class just very dull, there are better distro options out there.",
          "I really enjoyed this class. It helped me to develop my writing skills, and the class discussions were always enjoyable! Be warned though, there is a lot of reading and there are a lot of quizzes, so you cannot slack.",
          "Not a huge fan.",
          "This isn't too bad of a class, but there is A LOT of reading and A LOT of quizzes. The papers are graded pretty harshly, but once you know what you're doing it becomes easier.",
          "I loved this class - Professor Breen is a great instructor and I really liked all the analyses she guided us through.",
          "Breen is a lunchpale instructor who punches the clock day in\u2fday out. She brought the heat each class.",
          "This was Professor Breen's first time teaching the Bible as Literature, and she made it an enjoyable class! There was a decent amount of readings and usually a quiz or two a week, which were stressful even though they weren't graded harshly. Two papers were manageable and if you talk to Breen she will be very helpful. Take this class whether or not you are a person of faith and you will gain a much deeper understanding for a text that has had immeasurable impact on the world. I really gained an appreciation for the artistry and history of the Bible. The reading and class discussion will also teach you about the history of composition, types of criticism, and how to find thematic connections throughout the Bible",
          "This course is interesting, and Prof. Breen is really nice. If you have not previously read the bible, you will have to work a lot harder than those in the class who have - it's doable, but it will require lots of reading before each class. Overall, glad I took it but did not do as well as I had hoped to. If you are a person who loves talking in discussions, this is the class for you. If you are not, beware.",
          "The class was fine; not a difficult course to satisfy the Literature Distro.",
          "This class has a ton of reading. Only take if truly interested in the Bible, not if you are trying to fulfill a Weinberg distro. Seriously, it is impossible to manage a busy student's schedule of classes and extracurriculars and read all material for each and every class each week. There are near daily quizzes each class too. The essay grading is extremely difficult. Somewhat interesting topic, but too wide of a topic to appreciate any particular aspect, would be better if more focused on one specific area.",
          "This class is more history and literature analysis than religion at all. I took it because I was raised in catholic school and in a religious family so I thought I might have a leg up, but it is completely unrelated to religion. There are 2 papers, 1 midterm, 1 final (either paper or test) and blog posts and readings all year. Teacher is a hellla harsh grader.",
          "This course has a fun concept. You could tell Professor Breen was new to teaching the course, but she knew a lot and her Medievalist background provided a lot of insight to how the Bible has been treated over the years. Lots of hand outs and group work, and you probably need to have a talkative class. Most of my class was quiet except for a few people. The blog posts were fun though, once we got the hang of it, although I never really saw full fleshed out debates of conversation beyond what was required.",
          "This class felt like high school. Much of class time was used to complete worksheets with peers which felt not only like a high school course but like a low level high school course, not a course at an elite university. I would honestly not recommend it which is disappointing because the subject material is so fascinating and the professor is very knowledgeable, but the course failed to take advantage of either of these two things. The course I felt had a lot of busy work, with worksheets and pop quizzes in class, and paradoxically made us input a lot of time to not genuinely learn which made us not genuinely care. I did not feel engaged when I had to fill out worksheets in class and neither did my peers I worked with, we just BSd the sheet to get it finished so we could leave. Again the course material is extremely fascinating and the professor is nice and knowledgeable but the course was just not engaging."

          "It was a good class, not too hard, not too easy. If you just do the readings and go to class it shouldn't be hard to do well.",
          "Easy A!! Honestly, very very doable. Readings are a pain, but they're actually NOT BAD if you just devote a few hours to do the reading and discussion posts. Midterm offers SO MUCH EC so after the midterm, its easy breeze. Also discussion posts are graded based on if you did them or not lol. Lectures are dry and kind of off-tangent all the time, but attendance is taken.",

          "Professor Leong really cares on whether you understand the material and the content of the English language within the context of Asian American studies",
          "I would highly recommend this course to any student even if you had never taken a college English class. The structure of the class made it easy to understand and it was organized to allow students to build skills as opposed to a focus on grades. The homework was not impossible and doable given the right amount of time. The material was interesting overall and the instructor really helped students to grow over the course of this quarter.",

It's a lot of reading but most of it is pretty enjoyable. Midterm isn't too bad and canvas posts are manageable as well. Probably the best lit distro one could ask for.",

          "I liked how the style of the class was less about blobbing out a 500 response twice a week, but concentrating on fewer pieces of quality writing",
          "Enjoyable course material, emphasis on student-led discussion",
          "This is more of an Asian American Studies class than a literature class, just keep that in mind. The texts were varied and my most were interesting. Class discussion is basically all student discussion, so quality really depends on who read and who your peers are. I wish Doug had led the class more. He's pretty chill, really cares about us and cares that we're reading and learning. Would recommend for a chill distro",
          "I became a better reader critically.",
          "Alright class, the texts are very recent",
          "Interesting texts and a decent distro, but grading is somewhat hard and the majority of the grade is based on a final paper. I don't feel like I left the class having learned that much more than I entered with aside from reading a few interesting books.",
          "I found the way this class was set up to be a bit interesting... Prof. Ishii was very adamant about wanting to make this class \"worth our money\" and then set up the class in a way where the students led discussion more than half of the time, where he only ended up lecturing about 20% of the time. The novels were interesting to read and there was not too much work, though.",
          "Very fun class. Class discussions are always fun and engaging, Doug and class are very encouraging about comments and thoughts on books. Readings are good too, although sometimes a bit much. Writing the final paper is really fun and he makes us write it before reading week so no stress for finals! Also a great support system, if you have a student event you participate in he will come, just ask!",
          "Doug is the best.",
          "There's a lot of reading, but it's good reading. Doug is awesome!",
          "Lots of good books & interesting discussions i love Doug",
          "Prof Ishii is a very fun person to learn from and I really like his teaching style-- there's a lot to read but it all feels important. 10\u2f10 good class to get you into college reading/writing from high school since he gives a lot of useful feedback and he's very approachable. Also pretty lax understanding about due dates, but it will be bad if you leave things to the very last minute (me af). Overall, a fun class with interesting readings where you're never left wondering what your grade is or what you did wrong.",
          "this course reminded me how much i love literature! it was so fun to apply an intersectional lens to the works, and doug makes any class incredibly enjoyable. i will miss this class a lot!",
          "You'll read some great books in this class. I've heard the texts themselves vary by instructor, but they'll always include great historical context. The sci-fi / poetry / films showed me the breadth of AsAm literature that exists and how crazy it is to read stories about people like you. Be prepared to spend a fair amount of time on reading - it's worth it.",
          "Prof. Ishii is a knowledgeable and enthusiastic instructor, a must take for Asian Am minors !",
          "If you know you will do the work, take this class. IF you're lazy, don't take this class. Doug is one of the good professors here but he's not here to be your camp counselor. He's not going to hold your hand at every moment unless you ask for it. He has set rules and you should follow them. He is forgiving but he doesn't like being taken advantage of either. The books that we read were great and the essays are doable if you try. So do your best.",
          "Take this class with Doug! He truly cares about his students' well being and is really good at focusing / act as sounding board for students' arguments during discussion. Really lenient grader, not a lot of work other than the readings. Amazing intro to lit class.",

          "I was a little bit disappointed by the selection of readings, but Professor Cutler is really interesting.",
          "This class was one of the best English classes at Northwestern thus far. Professor Cutler is so down to earth and is passionate about the material he teaches. His lectures keep the entire class engaged and he gives a very reasonable amount of work for the amount of reading we do for class. He makes his expectations for your work very clear and wants to help you if you have any issues understanding the material we cover or want advice on how to improve a previous paper. Would definitely consider taking another class with him during my time at Northwestern.",
          "Overall, the class isn't too hard but is a little higher maintenance. It is a lot of reading, although most of the passages aren't super long. Four essays over the quarter, plus a group project.",
          "Cutler is a great professor. His lectures are engaging, and although he doesn't assign a ton off reading, he pulls a lot out of the texts you do read. Excellent low-stress English class.",
          "I really enjoyed taking this class, Professor Cutler is an amazing lecturer.",
          "This class was very interesting. I genuinely enjoyed every text that we read and discussed, and by the end of the course I had a more concrete idea of what constitutes Latinx literature. Professor Cutler is funny and cool, and his passion for Latinx literature made discussions interesting and engaging. While my critical reading skills improved in this course, I think my writing stayed pretty much the same, but when I enrolled in this course my focus was on improving critical reading primarily.",
          "This is a very good class! Professor Cutler is great and super funny! I feel like we never analyzed the readings as much as I would like. We would sometimes have 3 readings and then briefly analyze only two of them. In class we often spent more time on background and context than the literature itself. I also wish all the writing workshops were st the beginning of the class, this way those skills can be utilized from the get go with the first essay.",
          "AMAZING PROF, READINGS, CLASS DISCUSSION. It's really difficult to find a class where you're learning so much, genuinely enjoying your time and being challenged, but Cutler is incredible. he is intelligent, funny, cares but doesn't take himself too seriously, and is so so passionate about the subject matter. The class readings are incredible and as someone who knew very little going in, I learned so much about both Latinx writers and history. most highly recommend",
          "I really enjoyed this course. I took it as a distro but it was a very good literature distro. Professor Cutler is great and really cares about his students. He made class fun and engaging, and sometimes funny. The readings for this course were very interesting and there is not a lot reading required. I recommend taking this class for a literature distribution.",
          "I loved this class! It wasn't a hard course. I had a lot of fun.",
          "Loved this class. Took it as a distro, but had to put in some work. Prof. Cutler was awesome, and the readings and discussions were all really interesting. All papers, no tests if you're into that sort of thing.",
          "I really enjoyed this class. Professor Cutler is awesome and I highly recommend taking any course with him.",
          "Professor Cutler is amazing and so is this class! As the course title indicates, it was a great intro to Latinx literature, to which I had not had any prior exposure. Cutler did an awesome job picking out readings and relevant materials, and this was the only class I always wanted to attend just because of how engaging the lectures are and how well he would pick out parts of the reading to discuss. More importantly, the course is extremely manageable \u2014 there is a very reasonable amount of reading, and even though there are four papers, two of them are revisions of past papers. Not only was this helpful in maintaining a healthy course load throughout the quarter, but it was an opportunity to look back on our own writing and actually improve it, which we rarely get to do in other English classes. I\u027d definitely recommend this course for the 200-level requirement for English majors, or just as an elective for anyone interested in Latinx subjects or literature.",
          "I enjoyed this class a lot. Class was mostly lecture-based, although active class participation was expected throughout. Prof. Cutler is one of the most hilarious profs that I've had (but maybe we just have the same kind of lame humor) and there wasn't one class that I can think of where I didn't laugh out loud at something that he said. He's great at keeping everyone engaged throughout the class, and I like the combination of critical reading through the lens of ethnic studies and contextualizing within larger themes within Latinx studies.",
          "Great Class. Cutler is great. The class is very manageable.",
          "I loved this course even though it was not in my realm of literature I had read in the past. The readings were very interesting to read and I also got to finish many things in advance.",
          "this course was fun and good distro!",
          "Loved this class! Def recommend! A really expansive survey of Latinx literature. The professor selected canonical texts as well as lesser known texts. The reading assignments were reasonable and easy to complete, but we still had so much to discuss during class. Really compelling concepts were introduced in this class, and I was definitely challenged to think in new ways because of this class.",
          "Professor Cutler is a rockstar teacher. He is charismatic, charming, funny, and kind. He is really smart and knowledgeable, and I would definitely recommend taking either this class or another class with him if you can.",
          "this is a really good English class to take taught by a really good professor. The readings are really short and a lot of poetry. Professor Cutler is really helpful in office hours and you can tell he wants you to succeed. The class is fun and you should go especially since he takes attendance.",
          "Overall, a great course. Professor Cutler is very lively, engaging lecturer. The reading load is light and the reading selections are very powerful. My only problem with this course was the group digital media project. The two options we had (Story Map or El Grito) were very limiting and didn't give much opportunity to demonstrate what we had spent the whole quarter learning. On the other hand, I did really enjoy the writing workshops that were sprinkled throughout the course and I felt like they really did improve my writing.",
          "I thought the combination of historical and literary analysis worked really well together and led to some compelling discussions. Professor Cutler is immensely knowledgeable and I learned a lot from his lectures. The essay prompts were all really broad but never too inaccessible or difficult.",
          "take this class. The workload is manageable. TAKE IT",
          "Really solid course. Prof Cutler is funny and engaging and gives a really solid overview of latinx literature. The workload is very reasonable and allows you to dig into the assigned readings as opposed to feeling like you're drowning in reading and not able to do readings with excellence."

          "Great lit class if you're interested in Latino Studies. I really enjoyed all of the pieces that were chosen for this class which helped understand latinos in the US and latino literature as a literary cannon.",
          "This class is really easy, at least the way Professor Aparicio teaches it a lot of the books are repetitive, and kind of about the same thing. TA Maria is really great, she writes extensive commentary on all of the short papers, does her best to hand these back in a timely fashion so we can apply her notes to are next paper and is a really fair grader. I think a big problem I had with Professor Aparicio was that she didn't really create an environment where people were comfortable to share their reactions to the material, especially not students who were non-Latino\u02fa. Sometimes she would respond to non-Latino\u02fa students' comments as though to suggest that they were not warranted to make observations about this literature, or that they were generalizing. Of course these kinds of comments are going to be generalizations; it is understood even of social science research that because it requires the compilation of several specific and variant cases into one analyses, the conclusions drawn are generalizations, and can contradict personal experience. I also think its inappropriate to call out specific students in the class for being Latino\u02fa, it really divides the class into people who have \"a right\" to speak on behalf of the Latinx community and the people who do not, and who therefore should not be commenting on Latino\u02fa literature. And then she wonders why nobody speaks up in class.",
          "I really enjoyed professor Aparicio's teaching style. She is very accessible to students and allows many interpretations of the text in class discussions. The timing of assignments is not ideal. We did not have a lengthy writing assignment until week 5 and then three more jammed in the last three weeks of the class followed by the final. In general, though, this is a great course, very interesting material, and not overly demanding.",
          "Take this class! I loved it. Did a lot of group work, but the readings were so manageable and so interesting. Aparicio wants to know how you feel about the readings so speak up. Only thing I did not like was how we had Canvas posts due the morning before class day, so definitely no procrastinating allowed.",
          "This is a great class to take. The work load is light however I did wish there was more group discussion so that the class doesn't get boring.",
          "Overall a great course. I was disappointed by a lack of classroom engagement at first, but it didn't take aware from the course material, which was fantastic. Aparicio is an amazing professor and she makes each class enjoyable.",
          "Amazing class. Loved the readings, the professor, and the discussions. Readings are pretty easy to keep up with and are often really interesting to read. Only four 2 page essays, weekly discussion prompts, and a final paper, so it was very manageable.",
          "This was a great course. All of the texts were interesting and Aparicio did a great job of pointing out the most important ideas of every text.",
          "class is not too hard, 4 essays and one final essay 8-10 pages, try to participate in class or you will lose a lot of points, can only miss class twice",
          "I really enjoyed this class! As a Spanish major, I will say I didn't know before that THIS CLASS IS TAUGHT IN ENGLISH! Regardless, we talked a lot about the latino\u02fa/x experience in the US and the stereotypes, myths, and realities associated with that experience. All of the poetry and novels we read were actually really interesting and enjoyable to read. We had responses to the reading due at 9 AM the days before class, which was sometimes stressful but nice because it forces you to get the homework done a few days before class. We had around four 1-2 page papers, where you analyzed the text and a final 8-10 page paper. IF YOU ARE A SPANISH MAJOR, and NOT a native Spanish speaker, it's definitely difficult to translate the discussions you have in class into a paper because apart from the responses all of your essays have to be in Spanish. Just be aware it's very doable but was definitely more difficult",
          "this class was super interesting and made me think a lot more about latinidad and what i means. i liked almost all of the texts that professor aparicio picked.",
          "The lecture was great and really stimulating. I enjoyed reading the texts because they were all very eye opening and offered a different aspect of Latino history. Even if you're not Latino you should take this course because it offers a better understanding of how Latinos have been treated in the U.S., and how literature has been affected.",
          "This was a fun and interesting course, but I felt that the prompts for the papers, which are 10% of your grade each, could have been a lot more specific and that the grading on them was a bit hard to follow, as in sometimes it felt like there was an answer that was expected."

He properly preps students in filmography terms that are initially unfamiliar to us all and also encourages us to provide any sort of perspective of the films watched as assignments during class. I definitely would recommend taking a class with Professor Davis to any student interested in watching films!",
          "This was an interesting course, looking at gender and sexuality and cinematography. I learned a lot about looking at a film beyond the plot and storyline. Also just learning about how the filmmaking plays into the storyline.",
          "I really enjoyed this class. The movies were interesting to watch and then hear more about in class.",
          "i loved this class. it made me think so different about the themes of gender and sexuality and also about how to watch films in general. take this class if you want to really improve your writing and have it be assessed by a professor who really gives amazing feedback and suggestions. he was a great person and professor",
          "This course was great! Professor Davis is a funny (if a bit awkward - in a good way), engaging, and excited professor who will meet his students where they are at in terms of background knowledge. Some of the films were a bit long, but overall the workload was not intense, and Professor Davis provided great feedback on every assignment.",
          "I really enjoyed the course. The teacher was great. The way he incorparated certain thoughts about movies were great. It was an open and fun course and i loves it.",
          "This was a super cool seminar. Professor Davis choose cool movies to watch and discuss and brought in relevant and interesting guest speakers.",
          "Good class that helped me learn a lot about movies and there was a lot of freedom to pick what movie you wanted to write about for your papers. The professor was also very helpful with explaining what he wanted to see in his papers.",
          "The course was very interesting, we watched movies that focused on the theme of the seminar, gender and sexuality. Some were more popular like moonlight and lady bird but others were something I probably would never have seen if not for this class. Class time consisted of discussing the movies and close scene analysis. You have to watch at least one, if not, two movies a week.",
          "Nick Davis is a phenomenal teacher. He truly cares about his students, offers valuable feedback, and organizes each lesson so that its an immersing experience for every student. Best teacher I've had at NU so far. This class is a decent amount of work (one/ two films every week and some writing assignments) but its worth it!!! IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING TAKING THIS COURSE/ ANY COURSE WITH DAVIS DO IT. I had no experience with analyzing films-I hardly even watched films- and I was pretty okay at writing, but this course has helped me gain so much.",
          "Great selection of films, Professor Davis is a great facilitator of discussion and provides really interesting background information for the films as well. And the papers were fairly interesting to write.",
          "Professor Davis seems to care and genuinely be interested in his students. However it gets to the point where participating in discussion becomes uncomfortable. He won't let people freely talk without going on a long response, commenting about what the person just said. I think he has good intentions but it makes class seem unnatural to participate in. Movies were interesting but he said he was going to focus a lot on masculinity since apparently NU students don't get offered that many classes. I think I would prefer him to start a different class on that topic because most of us hadn't taken a gender class before so I felt like he was taking other people's ideas and putting it on first year students. Rather I would've like a greater survey of movies. We didn't get to movies about women until later in the class.

          "I cannot stress how much I loved this course. The material was extremely interesting and really pertinent to issues that still exist today. The workload was definitely manageable, and the readings were enjoyable so it didn't always feel like work. This is a really good course as a freshman seminar, as it eases you into what taking humanities classes at Northwestern is like. The papers were all extremely manageable (3 papers 3-5 pages, one final paper) and the ability to rewrite them makes you a better writer. Dr. Partridge truly cares about the material she teaches and truly cares about how her students feel in her class.",
          "The most important part of this course was actually attending the seminars--the discussions were really helpful and beneficial to learning about the course content. The readings were really bulky, so don't fall behind on them.",
          "I think something very important for this course is to keep up with the readings because there is a lot, and if you fall behind, it's hard to contribute to discussions. Amy's discussions are pretty engaging and did change how I viewed women's health and feminism in general.",
          "Very long lectures- would think this class is somewhat discussion centered because of the small amount of people in it, but hardly ever were there times to discuss ideas (even the readings) with others. Not only did the class not discuss the readings but a lot of the readings were never brought up even by Amy. Was kind of frustrating considering the extensiveness of some of the readings you have to do. Overall Amy is very nice and helpful if you go to her, but in class can sort of drag by because tangents occur every single class. Amy is incredible though and was very supportive and helpful for the transition into college!",
          "Overall, this is an interesting course, however, I do not feel like I learned as much about the women's health movement as I would have liked to, as often times, the content of this course was mostly geared towards fitting a specific feminist narrative, rather than considering all perspectives involved. Its an interesting topic, but is taught only looking at the feminist perspective, without actually considering the practicality of any other sides involved.",
          "Great class, very interesting material, but the professor never stopped talking. It was basically a monologue and ever so often she would ask the class a question, but no no one would answer because it would take her at least ten minutes to ask a question. We also did not discuss most of the readings that we did, which is kind of frustrating. But the material is great and the assignments are pretty fun to write.",
          "I really loved this course. The readings, films, and topics were super interesting. I liked how what we learned was connected to current issues and hot-button topics today. This class inspired me to switch my major to Gender Studies!",
          "okay course, lots of reading and papers were graded a little harder than expected. thought this class would be more of a discussion but mostly just Amy talking and a few comments from the few who usually speak in class",
          "This course wasn't too bad you have to attend every class as that is the only way you will gain any information. The lectures are pretty boring but the professor is really nice. There are 3 short papers (3-4 pages) and then one final paper. The grading is tough but you can resubmit assignments to get points back.",
          "Discussions were interesting, but sometimes prolonged to the extent I had no idea what we were even talking about anymore. You really have to focus for the whole class or else you will fall behind really easily. All the writing assignments were back loaded into the last few weeks of the class which was stressful around finals time. You really need to stay on top of your work in order to \"stay on the bus and not get crushed by the next one\"."

          "An extremely interesting and fun course to take for a distro that is a bit heavy on reading, but is not too time-consuming. The papers push you to think critically so they can be challenging, but the class prepares you very well to take on these topics.",
          "This is one of the best classes I have taken at NU. Carrillo made me smile every day. I planned on dropping this class because it doesn't fulfill any requirements for me, but every class I went to was so satisfying that I could not let myself drop it.",
          "This is a really interesting course and Professor Carillo is a good lecturer; it's somewhat challenging but overall worth it",
          "I feel like I have a comprehensive understanding of the history of human sexuality, which is awesome.",
          "This course is AWESOME- by far my favorite class I have taken at Northwestern. The material is super interesting and the professor is super cool and passionate about the topics taught in class.",
          "It was very good. I liked that my attention was grabbed in every lecture. Unfiltered",
          "Very interesting class. highly recommended. you will learn a lot about sexuality in this course. Professor carrillo fuse various perspectives and schools of thoughts together without confusing one perspective with another. contents are interesting. though you have to read a lot readings for that class, most readings are fun and even mind-blowing. good course to take if you want to see what gndr study is like",
          "The topics covered were super compelling and interesting, but sometimes the assigned reading could be way too overwhelming.",
          "The course is great and well-structured. It consists of one midterm and two essays, all of which are manageable if you review the major aspects of each sociologist you discuss in class and their respective reading assignments.",
          "The class is named Sexuality and Society, yet there was ONE reading on queer female sexuality in the entire class. Often during class Professor Carrillo (who is a great instructor) would make claims about homosexual identity or sexuality using research that exclusively talked about gay men. I found this bias and general lack of content on queer female sexuality incredibly disappointing and uncomfortable at times.",
          "weekly discussion questions can be annoying but lectures are interesting and fun. lots of reading and you have to do them. go to lectures!",
          "I found the course very interesting and relevant to modern society. I would highly recommend the course.",
          "Amazing class, Professor Carrillo was a great instructor and the course material was very interesting, work wasn't ridiculously tough but readings could be a bit dense at some points. Essays and test are manageable as long as you allocate time well.",
          "The professor absolutely ROCKED this class. It was one of the most fun and engaging classes that I have had at Northwestern. Considering it was a larger sized lecture, we still had discussions during class that helped me to keep engaged.The readings were very insightful but at the same time there were too many to keep up with.",
          "The lectures were engaging and for the most part the materials felt relevant.",
          "Carrillo is THE BEST. He truly cares that we\u2019re learning and engaged and happy. The course material is very interesting although I wish we spent more time studying sexual identities. I came away with a much deeper understanding of sexuality, but no \u201canswers\u201d because there are none. But it\u2019s definitely helped me reflect on my own sexuality and question all the scripts I\u2019ve been told my whole life. It\u2019s changed the way I think and I am so grateful. The course isn\u2019t that difficult and is truly worth it.",
          "This class is such a good elective to take! It's so so interesting and brings up aspects of sexuality I had never even thought about. Carillo is so energetic and keeps the lectures interesting.",
          "This was my first gender studies class at Northwestern. I am an engineer and I took the class because I was interested in this topic. I thought this class was really great and I enjoyed it a lot. From Professor Carrillo's general care and interest in this class to the supportive TAs, I felt this that class made me comfortable around a topic that I knew little about. I learned a lot because we covered a lot of topics. The readings can be a lot, but in class we really break them down and get the main ideas cleared up. The discussion section was sometimes boring but came in handy for reviewing for the midterm and prepping for writing the essays. In general, I think that if you are thinking of taking a gender studies class that this would be a good option.",
          "This class is great. The material keeps you engaged and Carrillo is a great lecturer and an overall wonderful and genuine human being. This class taught me so much about sexuality and the ways in which it operates in society. I'm glad I took this course. For those of you being financially conscious of courses and course materials--all you need is a clicker subscription in this class. All of the readings are online thanks to Carrillo.",
          "TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HECTOR. He's the most enthusiastic professor I've ever had, and he's the kind of professor that makes you want to go to lecture. The readings were varied and interesting, and nothing's off the table in this class and discussion. A great intro to gender and sexuality studies if you're pursuing that. Highly recommend.",
          "This is an enjoyable course, although a bit heavy on the readings. Professor Carrillo is great and watching him teach was always a joy, but some aspects of the course were a little overdone/their purpose was not clearly communicated.",
          "If you're debating taking this class then just go for it, especially if you're not a sociology/psych major. A lot to learn about sexuality (not much about sex though; if you take the class you can easily explain the difference ;) ). Carrillo is a fantastic prof, very eager to teach and amazing at explaining stuff. Also authored some of the reading you'll do in the class, which is honestly not that much (I usually did them in 1-2 hours the day before each class).",
          "I went into this class thinking that I was fairly knowledgeable about the subject, but I was surprised by how much I learned. Professor Carillo is an amazing professor, and his lectures are always very engaging and interesting. I really enjoyed the polls he conducted in class. In terms of the discussion section, I think it really varies, depending on which group you get. For the most part, I had a positive experience, but opinions can definitely become very polarized."

          "Disappointing course. A little too basic if you are an informed person and have \"stayed woke\" over the past few years in regards to sexuality.",
          "CARILLO IS THE BEST BUT THE AMOUNT OF READINGS ARE RIDICULOUS. like if you can't handle reading 80 plus pages every weekend don't take this course. some of the material is thick and he doesn't cover it in class so it's very easy to confuse concepts and authors. if you at least skim all the readings and pay attention and participate you will do very well. YOU LEARN ALOT OF COOL THINGS ABOUT SEXUALITY AND SOCIETY AND GENDER IN THIS COURSE. VERY WELL WORTH IT. LECTURES ARE NEVER BORING. TAKE THIS CLASS, JUST LEARN HOW TO MANAGE THE WORKLOAD.",
          "Great class. Carrillo is a great professor, Ryan is a great TA, and the course material is very interesting. Some of the readings I felt were a bit too complex and over people's heads for this type of class (Foucault), but most of them were fine. I also loved that our final was an essay due two weeks before finals week - very helpful for graduating seniors!",
          "This class is hard but it's a really interesting class if you're willing to put in the work. Difficult to keep up on readings but you definitely need to do them. No final though and that was super chill, just a midterm and 2 critical essays which definitely challenge you intellectually. Also Carrillo is good about making lecture a discussion which is cool.",
          "Carrillo is an amazing professor! Very engaging lecturer, not too hard of a class if you do the readings (which are interesting). Just a midterm, two final papers, and some responses for the TA sections.",
          "Interesting content. Very doable workload but graded more difficultly than you would expect.",
          "This class starts out easy, but it gets harder very quickly. Don't let yourself get behind on readings because you won't be able to catch up very easily. It's a fun, interesting class, but make sure you keep up with all the work.",
          "This course wasn't as easy as I wanted it to be. The topic is interesting, but the class is very centered around the readings, so you really need to do them if you want to participate in class and be better prepared for the midterm and papers. Carrillo is an awesome professor though--really nice and engaging and funny.",
          "Personally I was not interested in the topic so that may be my bad, but the course was very boring to me.",
          "Good class, professor is really caring and nice. Do not have to do the readings, only to write the critical essays.",
          "This was a moderately interesting course. On the bright side, the midterm is very fair, and the two papers are challenging but not impossible.",
          "I enjoyed this class. There is quite a bit of reading that you need to stay on track for so that you can do the assignments without too much stress, but I feel like the readings were beneficial. Professor Carrillo is a great professor and a wonderful human being.",
          "Super interesting. Well structured class. Carrillo really knows what he is talking about and keeps it interesting. Good class for someone who's never taken a gender studies class. One midterm and two essays 5 page.",
          "lecture is interesting. hector carrillo is quite a character! i learned a lot in this class. it's a great overall intro to gender/sexuality studies",
          "It was a good class.",
          "Good course, Prof Carrillo is super cool. Heavy reading though",
          "This class is a lot of reading, and the paper assignments are confusing. But the midterm is pretty easy. The content itself is fascinating and Hector is so passionate. But the readings are sometimes dry, and there's a lot of them that are a lot of pages. Easy B, work harder for an A.",
          "Started off really interesting but kind of went downhill. Still a fun class but lectures have gotten boring.",
          "I really really loved Professor Carillo. He was so engaging and clearly really excited to teach this subject. Because he was so excited about it it made me want to learn!",
          "make sure you're REALLY passionate about gender studies classes before you take it, it's an interesting class but the readings were slow and long and the papers were hard",
          "All in all a pretty easy class. That said, I know a lot of people who were surprised by low grades. The material is interesting and thought provoking but some of it is a bit boring (especially in the beginning of the course).",
          "A lot of the readings are really inaccessible, especially if you don't have prior experience with gender studies. I really struggled with understanding some of the concepts, especially when we talked about identity. It's all very complex. Also, there is no way anyone would ever be able to do all the readings for this class, but you can get away with only doing some of them. But overall, it's a very interesting class and challenges you to think.",
          "very enthusiastic and well prepared professor, surprisingly material can get boring at times, midterm is very straightforward",
          "AMAZING COURSE!!!!!! take this class! TAKE IT!!! Carillo is an incredible man and prof. this class is so extremely interesting and it is easy to excel.",
          "A fairly easy class with really unnecessarily long readings. You have four readings due each class and you barely talk about them until it's time for a paper or the midterm. I really didn't love how this class was set up, you're just kind of talked at quickly and expected to retain all of it on your own because the TAs don't help with review they just kind of sit there. No final, which is nice, but not the most interesting class you could use as a distro.",
          "This class was my favorite at Northwestern. Whether you're taking this as a distro or as a requirement, it's truly eye-opening. You'll even have fun writing the papers and will learn more than you could ever imagine.",
          "Cool class. It's a breath of fresh air to be in a class with different people than are in all of my other classes. Carrillo is interesting and his articles were interesting",
          "This class is super interesting and Carrillo is fantastic. You can tell he's really invested in the material and is great at discussing it. The readings are interesting, but you can get away with not reading most of them. Just make sure your essays are really good because they constitute a good chunk of your grade. There are two in the second half of the quarter, and other than the midterm, they're the only assignments for the quarter.",
          "This class was a lot less interesting than I thought it was going to be. I thought it would really talk about issues that are important today, but it focused a lot on Freud and Kinsey which do not feel relevant today. The lectures were only interesting when the students got to participate in polls, but otherwise they felt dry. The discussion sections were SO dull and the readings were not interesting enough to keep the conversation going for 50 minutes.",
          "carillo is an AMAZING professor. take this class -- ton of readings but all interesting",
          "Awesome class! A must take if you are at all interested in sexuality in society. Even if you're not, expand your horizons. Professor Carrillo is awesome - enthusiastic, engaging, smart, funny, etc. You'll enjoy going to class, and won't feel stressed.",
          "This class was interesting. However, there was a TON of reading and the lectures were extremely dry. Carillo is incredibly nice, but not a very lively lecturer.",
          "This class was pretty entertaining toward the beginning, hit a slump in the middle, and picked up again at the end. Hector is a great lecturer and the material is pretty interesting. The readings, however, can be dense occasionally, and it's difficult to keep up with them constantly. Overall it was one bluebook midterm and 2 analytical papers (no final).",
          "One of the best classes at Northwestern. Everything we learned was relevant to the overall theme of the class. Professor Carillo does an outstanding job in presenting the material in class and Ryan, my TA also helped facilitate our discussion. I have never questioned so much about the notion of sexuality as I have in this class.",
          "The course is very reading heavy, with challenging texts as the bulk of the work. It requires synthesis of various ideas in order to succeed. The lectures are engaging, though a bit long.",
          "good course, not a super easy A, but if you're interested in the subject youll learn a lot",
          "Take this class! Professor Carrillo is so enthusiastic in his lectures and loves for students to engage with the concepts and the work being presented. The beginning of the class is very theory-heavy (Kinsey, Freud) but still very much at an introductory level, and then toward the end it gets more to relevant social issues involving sexuality. Readings were sometimes long. There was one midterm, two critical reviews essays, and no final. Overall pretty solid class.",
          "This is my favorite class that I've taken at Northwestern so far. Carrillo is amazing--his lectures are actually amusing and very interesting. The readings are ridiculously long and there are a ton but I survived the entire quarter without doing them.",
          "This class was not what I thought it would be. Going in I already had a decent interest and understanding of sexuality issues, so honestly this class didn't teach me anything that I didn't already know. It was way more reading than I thought it would be, and was quite frankly more work than it was worth.",
          "Great class! Professor Carrillo is very energetic and encourages everyone to participate even though it's a lecture. Much more opened minded to all perspectives than other gender studies classes. He does a great job at breaking down interesting concepts, which are very relatable. Not too difficult, Professor goes over the readings in lecture. Midterm is based entirely on lectures, essays on reading.",
          "This class is NOT A JOKE! I enrolled for this class thinking it would be a fun and interesting way to get an A, but it ended up way harder than I thought it'd be. Hector is a great professor and he knows his stuff, but he had a hard time keeping the class interested. THE KEY TO DOING WELL IN THIS CLASS IS TO DO THE READINGS! There are a ton of readings, but the only way to do well and to understand the class is to read the texts that Hector assigns. The best part of this class was definitely the videos he showed in class.",
          "A lot of outside assigned reading. Exams were straightforward.",
          "Work hard on the papers and study for the midterm and you will be fine. Also a warning, he doesnt give the paper prompts until a week befor e so stay updated on the reading and youll be set to answer the prompt.",
          "Prof. Carrillo is really good, and the topics are very relevant. There's only a midterm and two essays.",
          "Great Class",
          "Readings were fun to do and helpful with lecture",
          "Great course. Sometimes it can be a bit boring.",
          "I enjoyed this course a lot. Lots of reading. The midterm is not hard as long as you do the readings. Have to really think about the papers",
          "Honestly, this class disappointed me. I really wanted to like it and it comes across as being super interesting. It's a shame because the subject is interesting and Hector Carrillo is an AMAZING professor but the format of the class makes it really boring. TONS of reading outside of class of dense, journal articles instead of more recent articles relating to current society. Not a hard class - only a midterm and 2 papers, but tons of reading that is really hard to get through. Not an easy A but definitely an easy B"

          "Course is interesting and not that hard. You don't have to do all the readings, just enough to get the discussion questions done and write solid papers. Lectures are interesting and Professor Norton is a very understanding, approachable guy. He wants you to enjoy the subject matter and do well.",
          "This class was really interesting and taught very well.",
          "I took this course as a last second distro, but was surprised by how interesting it was. It changed my way of thinking. It was a lot of reading and the papers were challenging but I learned a lot.",
          "A wonderful survey of issues I knew I was interested in but didn't know much in-depth about, excepting personal experience. Thoroughly enjoyed being challenged.",
          "A lot of reading, super fun interesting lectures",
          "This was a great class. It's organized really well and Professor Norton is so nice and knows how to keep lectures interesting.",
          "This class is very interesting and has a good range of interesting material and videos",
          "There was a lot more reading than I was expecting, and much of it was very dense. That said, Aaron gives really good lectures and you can often get away with reading one out of several readings for each class, or skimming all of them. Overall, there are a lot of very cool discussions about complex ideas relating to sexuality.",
          "Professor Norton is amazing. Having class with him was really fun. People had different opinions and they could voice it without feeling judged. Most of the readings were easy and really interesting.",
          "This is such an incredible course. Professor Norton is an amazing teacher and absolutely hilarious. Its not an easy A, but if you do work and pay attention, its not hard to do well.",
          "It covered a great range of topics from women's issues to racism. There was no issue the course shied away from.",
          "SUCH AN INTERESTING COURSE. Aaron is a very funny and enjoyable lecturer; lots of polls in class; fun music at the beginnings. He knows his information and relays it well. Do the readings each week, they're actually really interesting.",
          "Very interesting. Essays were tough",
          "This course was very interesting and Aaron is a great professor.",
          "This course is great. I learned a lot while still not doing much work. The professor is truly amazing - so funny and knowledgable.",
          "Professor is nice, but his exam questions are not that nice",
          "He does not fully use slides, so if u are a visual learner, it could be hard to catch up his saying",
          "General learning about gender and society, learning a lot, broadening ur perspective on world, yet quite lots of reading",
          "I took this course because I thought it was a distro BUT IT IS NOT A HISTORY DISTRO. Aaron is very funny and sweet, but he could ramble at times. We did polls which needed a clicker\u02fclicker technology which were cool. Both papers were very demanding and mentally taxing to write because of how theoretical they were. Todd was a great TA. CRAZY AMOUNT OF READINGS!!!! Some days had over 60+ pages, and there was NO WAY TO KEEP UP.",
          "A good gender studies intro. The readings are interesting but the overview of sexuality is pretty basic. If you've taken gender studies before/ are LGBT, you will spend a lot of time rolling your eyes. If not, then its a good 101",
          "This course is super interesting! The reading is relatively heavy and a little dense at times, but at other times it is super interesting and a little raunchy! My professor gave excellent lectures, so on occasion I could definitely get by without doing the reading. There is one exam, which you can definitely get a good grade on if you review powerpoints, and two 5-6 page essays.",
          "This is a great class! Aaron is hilarious and an amazing teacher! The readings are super interesting (kinda long) but usually worth it. The two papers are difficult but doable",
          "You'll learn a lot in this class if you haven't had much experience with gender studies before and it's really a lot of fun. My only complaint was that the professor has tailored the course material so that it focuses very heavily on homosexual men; while it's an interesting topic I think the class would be better served by spreading the focus out a bit",
          "Best professor that I had this quarter. Aaron makes class unbelievably fun. All the information that you need for the midterm is from the lectures but the readings are definitely helpful in providing additional details about lecture topics. Discussion sections are thought-provoking. Most material is relevant in today's society. GREAT COURSE",
          "I took this class to see if I was interested in Gender and sexuality studies and was disappointed. The vast majority of the readings\u02fcontent in the class was focused on/written by men. Professor Norton has a very roundabout lecture style. The prompts for the essays were too broad. We were asked to discuss 5 articles in a 5 page paper which made it virtually impossible to focus on a narrow specific subject and really dig deep into it while still following the prompt.",
          "So informative, Norton is an amazing professor, totally manageable amount of work, and always emotionally and intellectually engaging. Such a wonderful class.",
          "Fantastic class! Aaron is amazing and brought light to so many important topics in such a fun, friendly, and perfectly quirky manner.",
          "I was pretty interested in this class material but then after the in-class midterm which actually had to relate to all the material covered during the first half of the quarter, I lost a lot of interest in the subject, mainly because the rest of the graded assignments were essays only covering one topic. Aaron Norton is such a soft-spoken guy but he is really nice and cares about his students. Really don't have to go to a lot of the classes after the actual midterm in class.",
          "The course overall is super interesting. A really great distro especially when taught by Prof. Norton. My ideas about sexuality were constantly questioned and I was consistently intrigued by the material.",
          "Discussion section was what made this class very worthwhile for me. Though lecture was interesting, I gained so much real world understanding from my TA (V) and the other students in my section. Aaron does a great job of clearing up the reading and presents the points you need to know.",
          "This was a fantastic class! Aaron is an awesome prof, and it was a really effective survey course, considering how easily it could have become unfocused with the massive amount of content covered. It made me think more critically about gender and sexuality, and even though a lot of the topics were not new to me, I found it to be really engaging and learned tons.",
          "In my opinion, this is a great course with a great instructor and great TA's. This course really opened my eyes to the complexities of sexuality as it relates to many aspects of our society that might not always be as straightforward as it may seem. Though some readings were quite long and some of them slightly difficult to grasp at first, Aaron and the TA's really help break it down into simpler terms. Highly recommend this class.",
          "This class really put me out of my comfort zone bc I've never taken a class on this topic before. A lot of reading but not entirely necessary that you do it. In class midterm and two take home essays. If you take this class be ready to feel uncomfortable!",
          "This course was such an eye-opening experience and it was funny and genuine and practical. Aaron Norton is an amazing professor",
          "This course was great! It was always interesting, and Aaron is really invested in the students and making class engaging. You learn a lot about modern issues while still learning about things you didn't know about before. The readings can be a bit long but they're usually interesting.",
          "I really enjoyed this class. I felt like Aaron was able to keep it fresh and keep things current. If something happened over the weekend that would relate to something we learned or are learning, he\u027d include it in the next lecture. Definitely a class worth taking if you're interested in learning about multiple forms of sexuality in our own society and societies around the world.",
          "Interesting, low-stress introductory course on sexuality and its interactions with sociology. As an LGBT student I came in having a deeper and different perspective because of my identity which likely left me to get less out of the class than others might have. Still the class had some interesting readings and discussions were informative on hearing about the experiences of others.",
          "The course was super interesting but at times a little too wishy washy for me.",
          "Professor Norton is a wonderful teacher and is very excited and open about the topics in Sexuality in Society. The class looks at a wide range of communities and theoretical frameworks, all of which were presented with engaging articles and lectures.",
          "Prof. Norton is amazing. He provides great readings and explains them very well. He was so fun and a great Prof. to have. Very good teacher as well.",
          "The instruction in this class was always engaging and broke down the readings without over-simplifying.",
          "This course is awesome. It introduced me to more ideas about sexuality in general and how people work in general and the importance of sex in people's lives. The professor is so nice, supportive, and his jokes are pretty good. It was a pleasure to take that class and learn about something that's considered so taboo. I'm sad it's over.",
          "I really enjoyed Prof. Norton's lectures -- he was engaging and thought-provoking, which made me happy to attend the larger courses. The midterm was fair, and the essays allowed deeper engagement with material, so I liked the assessment methods in the course.",
          "Aaron was an incredible professor! This course wasn't too hard, with a discussion section, midterm, and two essays (one of the essays was the final). It was also super interesting.",
          "This course is great! Very interesting content and taught by a very fun professor. I actually enjoyed writing the essays and doing the reading",
          "fantastic course with a great professor. Norton is such a nice person and makes most of the lectures really interesting. readings and class material are all super interesting, a few of the readings were a bit long. midterm is pretty easy and only two essays, which aren't graded too hard.",
          "I thought that the breadth of topics that we covered through different texts provided a comprehensive view of the subject and I found the readings interesting to read. Additionally the papers for this class felt easy to write due to the wealth of information I gained from the course."

          "I absolutely loved this seminar-style course. The readings were, for the most part, super engaging and interesting. I would 100% recommend this course. Professor Stokes is the coolest and is also considerate about students' needs. She is always willing to help and responds quickly to emails.",
          "Well... The other options for the \"Historical Studies\" distro made me want to pull my teeth out with my bare hands. This class wasn't awful, but I wish it were an actual history course. It\u027d definitely not; instead, it's about reading articles at home and discussing in class about their impact or something. Not what I'm interested in, sorry!",
          "Love this course so much, it was honestly v interesting. IT SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO TAKE A TRANS* HISTORY COURSE!!!!",
          "I thought his course was really good, I loved the topic and really enjoyed learning about trans identities throughout history.",
          "Trans history is not Trans studies. I don't feel that this should be in the gender studies department if the faculty is not an adjunt gender studies prof.",
          "This is such an amazing course. I absolutely adore the fact that Northwestern offers classes like this. It's so important, and this class is absolutely fascinating. Also Professor Stokes is a GEM",
          "This was such an important class for me. I hope that Northwestern continues to offer more classes about trans history and trans studies.",
          "I don't feel like I was particularly challenged or enlightened in this class, but it was definitely interesting at times and an overall enjoyable class.",
          "I enjoyed the readings focusing on queer/LGBT life in Paris, focusing on institutionally forgotten or minimised aspects of history",
          "I LOVED this course. Awesome subject matter, interesting professor, fun lectures. Workload was super manageable, my favorite class this quarter.",
          "This course helped me learn about the unspoken and important presence that trans people have had throughout history. It also clarified the terminology that is used today to describe and discuss trans issues, while also acknowledging and displaying the differences in vocabulary because of generational gaps, geography, and other factors. This was also one of the first history courses I've taken, and I was able to explore the Northwestern archives for the first time, look at primary sources, and take a gender studies topic from a historical perspective.",
          "The course was very well structured, pairing academic and historical readings with in course discussion and collaboration. Professor Stokes facilitated thought provoking instruction and did a fantastic job of tailoring the course to our class's needs. There were three short papers and a final project, that allowed for creativity in the form of an art project.",
          "While it is clear that Professor Stokes is amazing and suer knowledgable on this content, her expectations for readings to prepare for class were CRAZY. No one is able to read 100+ pages of dense text between 2 days of class. Also, I feel like I would have gotten a lot more out of the class if it would have been lecture-based instead of discussion-based. We have this amazing professor in front of us and I wanted her to just teach us the material insead of listening to classmates talk about the readings for the entire class period.",
          "This was my first history class and provided an historical approach to transgender studies. I found that the course lacked clearly articulated throughlines/themes, and it was hard to connect the readings to the scholarship we read."

          "Have you ever heard of a course named this before? NO, because nu doesn't offer enough intersectional courses!!! take it regardless of your background to be mindblown and learn about actual us history, cry a lil, get mad, etc. take advantage of the research paper (which is most of your grade) to write about something you are actually interested in!! and START EARLY! Professor Yuh is one of the smartest coolest profs at this school so you better do this",
          "Professor Yuh is an insightful instructor and historian that presents history in an interesting and engaging way. I'm someone who hasn't liked history classes in the class, and this was perfect. Never was I bored or overwhelmed, and I really enjoyed the class discussions.",
          "The class is structured like a lecture for classes, and then a discussion every other class. It's best to enter the class with a decent background in world history or asian-american history, as it brings more to the table for discussion. There were a lot of awkward pauses in class where Yuh would ask a question and no one would be able to answer.",
          "This was a good introduction to Asian American women throughout American history. Yuh is a great professor who clearly is extremely well-versed in this topic. She facilitates discussion well in class and constantly encourages students to attend\u02fcommunicate with her through office hours. I\u027d say the class had a bit too much group discussion for my own taste (much prefer listening to her lecture), but overall I enjoyed being in class and it was very stimulating material. I also found some of the readings to be a bit dry \u2014 we did a lot of anthology reading, while I thought the other resources she offered were much more thought-provoking and engaging.",
          "This class opened up my understanding of history beyond what I could have imagined",
          "Loved it",
          "Yuh could do a little better with organization of the course but the material and inesteuxrion was really valuable! Only a few assignments but she grades hard so they all count.",
          "Yuh is really cool and the weekly readings aren't much. Three easy enough to do response papers and a 10 page final of your subject choice. Felt personal and would recommend.",
          "Dr. Yuh is PHENOMENAL. She's extremely knowledgeable and very willing to work with students on assignments, etc. She knows what she's talking about, and gave a good survey of Asian American women from East and South East Asia. We very briefly touched on South Asian women, but the focus is on Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Japan. Dr. Yuh's academic work is also on Korea. The class was a little boring at times because it was done as small groups rather than lecture\u02fdiscussion style, but the work generally was productive and helpful.",
          "much reading please do it though it is super awkward to be the only person in class who contributes to discussion and Yuh is such an important Asian American scholar do not take her for granted"

          "This class was great! It was a bit intimidating when I looked at the assignments for the quarter, but it's much less formidable when you begin, just don't start late. I'm glad I liked writing papers/was good at writing them. LaShonda is fun, quirky, and extremely knowledgeable. Black women's history is so important and is a fundamental class that everyone should take!",
          "Lashonda is an abnormally engaging professor. Her investment in the material is unparalleled, and her willingness to teach is abundantly clear. I think that this quarter she was getting used to the quarter system, as it seems that she tried to pack a semesters worth of material into a quarter, which ended up being a lot of work. Also, the final paper is a comprehensive research paper, and i think that that could potentially turn people off to the GSS department.",
          "When taking this course, I expected a more general into to Roots of Feminism class, but quickly learned LaShonda would be teaching it in a very different way, which I ultimately enjoyed, but a bit disappointed I did not take the traditional Roots of Feminism class. We have been told that this class will no longer be taught by LaShonda and someone else will be taking it over and teaching it in the more common vein of a traditional class. I could see how this class would be frustrating to gender studies majors who needed these intro level Feminism classes to be adequately prepared for future more intense Feminism class.",
          "The course material was awesome, but the instruction was much too geared towards note taking instead of expanding on the knowledge presented in the texts.",
          "This course is extremely interesting. There is a lot more reading and writing than strictly necessary to learn the material, so I wouldn't recommend taking it unless you are really interested in the subject. I had to take it for my major, and probably would have dropped if I didn't have to keep taking it because of the workload and the way lectures were structured.",

The readings are not always necessary to do, but make sure you at least have some idea of what it was about so that you can participate. Some of the essays seem pointless, but in the end you realize they will help you with your final paper. I learned a lot.",
          "Lashonda is a very hip professor but this class with her is a lot of reading and writing. She also calls on people to speak in class, which is panic-inducing",
          "This is a really great course, it's interesting and you will learn a lot if you are willing to put in the time. Fair warning though, it's a lot of work, with a 200 page final essay",
          "LaShonda is one of the most engaging and engaged professors I've ever encountered, but the lectures are mostly summarizing readings, which felt like a waste of time.",
          "Take this class! Professor LaShonda is not only incredibly knowledgeable about the subjects of African American women's history, literature, and feminism, but also takes the time to bring the concepts learned about in the readings to current issues. Like any other class, do the readings and come to class prepared and you will do well.",
          "LaShonda is an awesome professor. She's very funny, engaging, and passionate. The class discussions were really interesting, but sometimes I felt like we were talking about the same things over and over again. This class is A LOT OF WORK. You have to do the readings every day (she will call you out if you don't), essays almost every week, attendance is taken, and a 20 page final paper. However, I think it was worth it because I learned a lot about a topic that's usually ignored in mainstream history and because LaShonda is a great professor.",
          "I think Professor Barnett's ability to push what I thought I knew about the portrayal of black women was very helpful in challenging my previous understanding of black women's history.",
          "This course was really reading and writing intensive.",
          "The professor and the TA were absolutely fantastic",
          "Very interesting course and LaShona is great, but requires a lot of work (i.e. writing like 8 papers, one of them being 15-20 pages)",
          "There were many assignments, but the material was interesting and was engaging, and the assignments were graded generously",
          "I loved the content of this course because it was all very new to me; however, the work load could be a little much at times. Many of our assignments were very heavy reading and papers every week, which is a bit heavy for a 200 level class.",
          "This course was not well designed for the quarter system. Too much reading. Definitely can get away without reading if you're a strong writer, though.",
          "What a course. Yes, this class demanded a lot of me, but really did succeed in pushing me outside my comfort zone. This is important material that I had very little exposure to before this course. I highly recommend taking a class taught by this professor.",
          "This class is a lot of reading and even more writing. It is challenging to actively participate in the class if you do not glance at the readings and take notes before class.",
          "This class taught me so much about African American women's history and found it invigorating to be learning about the creation of feminism or womanism in the African American community which is not talked about when learning about feminism in other classes.",
          "This course was daunting at first, but the TA's and professor were very understanding of the challenges students may have throughout the course.",
          "For me, the parts of the class that were the most important were the lively and expert lectures by the professor, the engaging discussions that occurred in class, and the readings that were assigned. Overall, I\u027d describe taking this class as a challenging yet enriching experience that was well worth the time I spent in it. While the readings were long and there was a rather large number of essays to write, I genuinely thought that the class taught me a lot of things about African-American women's history, culture, and experiences that I didn't know beforehand and helped shape me into a more knowledgeable, socially aware citizen.",
          "Lashonda can be disorganized but facilitates really good discussions.",
          "The course load was actually wild (it would have fit a semester schedule better) and it was nearly impossible to get all of the reading done. Buuut it wasn't hard to still participate in discussions. This class was not treated like an intro class, which is what it is so that was kinda frustrating. Also the final paper was 15-20 pages and everyone I know who was also in the class was dying over it so yeah that kinda sucked but we got to pick our own topics so that was cool. The material itself was poppin though, like yes finally there's a class that's centered on the history of Black women. *snaps*",
          "I LOVED THIS CLASS AND LASHONDA BARNETT WITH ALL MY HEART. I'm not sure if LaShonda will still be teaching this course but if she is you absolutely must take it! I had heard that this class was super whitewashed so I was hesitant about taking it but I guess Northwestern figured that out and changed up the professors. The work load was a tiny bit absurd but its fine if you can deal with a million readings a week and an essay due every other week.",
          "LaShonda was an amazing teacher, but did a little too much hand holding. She explained the material very well, and got to the major points of the authors. The course was well paced, and not overwhelming. As a prereq for GSS majors/minors, it is a good class, especially when taught from Black women's history. It did NOT address the intersection of Black and queer, which was a major issue.",
          "I am so disappointed in this class. It was terrible. From day one, LaShonda was unprepared and rude. Also, if you're actually a Black woman, ironically you'll enjoy this class the least, as it is just a clapping party for non-Black women and those who say 'nice' things about us. So so so much wrong with the instruction of this course. Also, neither of the TAs were Black? The prof came close to an hour late one time to class and proceeded to tell the class that WE sucked. Little to no help with questions regarding material. Very elitist view on Black politics, such is the life of being so embedded into academia. She also often misgendered a student in the class. I don't recommend the class at all. Go to the AfAm department and get some real critical thinking on Black women's history.",
          "This course was a lot of work... a lot. And it was so worth it. I have yet to take a course in college where I was excited to actually put in the time for the amount of reading that was required. LaShonda did an excellent job of facilitating class discussion during lecture, which made class time worthwhile. Before taking this class, I was ignorant of how much information gets left out of US History when black women aren't included. I not only learned so much about history, but also about how historical trends pervade our own society. If you want to take a class that is hard work and worth it, this is it.",
          "This class approaches the very important topic of African American Women's History. I do not recommend taking this class with Professor Barnett as it seemed as though she took a semester course load and stuffed it into a quarter. The classes were not incredibly well organized, as there were no powerpoints or very specific things to learn, but the reading materials were interesting overall and the essays were not incredibly difficult, except for the final 15 page paper. Overall, I think the topic something that everyone should learn about, but I do not believe that Prof. Barnett was the best professor for really teaching everyone about the importance of the subject.",
          "The classes weren't helpful unless you read and there were too many readings to do realistically with a heavy course load.",
          "I learned A LOT from this class! It was also a lot of work though.",
          "Being a person of color in this class can be difficult because you are still in the minority. It can be frustrating when you're overlooked, especially being a Black woman and discussing the aspects of life FOR a Black woman, but I appreciate the class for allowing me to debate and not be closed off to other opinions and interpretations of text. The analysis I cared the most for, and I'm satisfied with all I was taught.",
          "This class is EVERYTHING (with a few minor details that one must take into consideration). Okay first of when else are you going to have the opportunity to take class taught by a BLACK, WOMAN professor who is teaching you about African-American Women's history? NEVER because it has not exist! This class will teach so much and help change the way that you view intersections of race and gender. Keep in mind that the book list is long (THERE ARE EIGHT BOOKS HOLY SHIT), but you can ACCESS THEM ALL FOR FREE ONLINE FROM THE NU LIBRARY!!!!! Secondly, there are a lot of pages to write for this class. The amount of writing required is insane like we did 6 to 8 different papers with varying lengths. You may be thinking wow I can't do that, but yes you can because you are smart. Third thing to keep in mind is that you HAVE TO READ everything (well not really bc I didn't read and not once was I called on), but essentially LaShonda loves, LOVES, LOVES to call on random students, and ask them questions about the reading so please take time to read (fill in:skim) the readings in order to feel semi-prepared.",
          "The topic of this class is so amazing and I loved the books that we were exposed to in this class. However, there were way too many essays. Literally on day 2 we wasted an entire hour and twenty minutes explaining what an annotated bibliography. Needless to say, class discussion gets sidetracked WAY too easily and often, its only the same people getting called on who say valid things, but there isn't a diverse opinion if its only some of the same people talking. The assignments didn't focus nearly enough on black women and there was an unnecessary amount of essays that did not do much to aid my understanding of the class.",
          "i really liked this class. very good reading materials and good conversation",
          "This course was very interesting, and LaShonda does a great job of engaging students during lectures. The books we read were great and provided so much information that is lost in most historical texts, so I feel like I learned a lot.",
          "I believe that the class was more focused on note taking and graphs than it was on the actual material. I don't feel like we discussed or learned to the best extent of Black women in history or their importance. I noticed my own deficits when I was writing my final paper, ultimately feeling like I should have learned more of this stuff in class than while doing outside research.",
          "I wish we had focused on the feminist movments more. They were barely discussed and I feel as though I didn't learn much about \"feminism\" as I did just about African American history. (There's a happy balance that I think could have been struck)"

          "I thought this course was very engaging and the discussion format of the class helped us to go beyond just the readings and see other people's perspectives.",
          "I enjoyed the class discussion style very much, as it allowed people to share ideas and everyone to get a goo understanding of the material without pressuring people who were more shy or introverted to participate just to got points.. the discussions were well organized as well",
          "This course was extremely interesting even as a student who has taken the Feminist Theory course for the major. I really appreciated that we discussed readings in class instead of having the lectures as a separate entity.",
          "The \"lecture\" sections are like full-group discussion sections. The discussions in class were really interesting and I was happy to just sit and listen most of the time, but you would definitely get more out of it if you keep up with the readings and participate.",
          "THIS IS THE BEST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN. Everyone should be required to take this class. I learnt so much about women, and the interlocking oppressions that exist due to race, class, gender and sexuality. I became a better writer, better thinker and more confident speaker. It was life-changing for me. Jennifer Nash is the best professor I have ever had. She is awesome. No regrets. TAKE IT TO BE BETTER AND LEARN SOOOO MUCH.",
          "This class really explored a wide variety of feminisms. It was clear that some people in the class really loved it. Definitely not a class that everyone would enjoy, but if you are interested in examining a real range of feminist texts, this class might interest you.",
          "There is a lot of reading. Luckily, they are very interesting but can take a lot of time. The lectures themselves are very engaging and Professor Nash is fantastic. The papers are relatively easy, but hopefully your TA is good. Do not take this class if you don't want to read. There is a final exam and three papers that require you to know the readings very well.",
          "Class participation is key. In class, there are \"regulars\" and \"semi-regulars\" when it comes to participation, so it can be difficult for a shyer person to get in. If you're a shy person, the discussion sections are a lot less intimidating, and it's a bit easier to get your participation points that way. As far as the readings, there are times where you need to take plenty of time out of your day to get them done, but they are very interesting nonetheless, and the arguments are usually straightforward. The professor and TAs do a fantastic job teaching the context of the readings to us. Also, the essays are quite fun to write since they are less about the readings and more about developing your own personal viewpoint. Overall, interesting subject matter, but expect a lot of class participation for a lecture course.",
          "Professor Nash is truly a phenomenal lecturer. She is engaging, passionate, and is great at facilitating lively discussion.",
          "Professor Nash is easily the best professor I have ever had at NU. She is kind, witty, engaged and just overall a great professor to have for such an important subject. Personally, I feel that every student at NU should be required to take one gender studies class \u2014 I just wish everyone could have Prof. Nash. The content is very intriguing and you will find yourself reevaluating your presence in this world from a gendered lens \u2014 all good things! Take this class. Seriously.",
          "This is an amazing course I think everyone should take it. It allowed me to see the world in a different light and I am a more mature thinker because of it!",
          "Just brilliant. Necessary to the way we think in today's day and age.",
          "You learn so much about interesting feminist discourses. However, the breadth of required reading was definitely discouraging and made the course less pleasant and tolerable than I would have hoped for.",
          "This class is a great introductory course for GSS majors/minors. It challenges a lot of the beliefs one holds about society in an academic way. There's 3 papers and a final, and the final is all about the readings so do the readings when they're assigned. The lectures were discussion based and always entertaining and informative",
          "Take a class with Prof. Nash. She's amazing.",
          "Readings can be very dense and class discussion can move very quickly. One of the most intellectually stimulating classes I've taken so far.",
          "Professor Nash is an all star professor. Not only is she extremely knowledgable and passionate, but she really facilitates and engages the class with every lecture. there was never a boring moment. It felt like everyone in class was passionate about being there and we all learned so much.",
          "A lot of work for a distribution requirement. Interesting topic, but the conversation was frequently dominated by GSS majors and was sometimes really lofty.",
          "This class was so interesting, but I was a little overwhelmed by the readings. Additionally, because it's so free form and discussion based, it's hard to know what the takeaway should be as a student (and what is necessary to know for finals).",
          "Prof Nash is super cool but I'm not a huge fan of how the class was run. I would have rather heard more of her own thoughts on and explanations of the material than listen to freshmen grasp at straws. She also definitely had her favorites and would call on them over others. But still a good distro with a lot of cool readings.",
          "Take this class with Prof. Nash !! She is one of the most engaging professors I've ever had - what could have been a standard\u02fboring lecture ended up being a thought-provoking and challenging discussion every single class.",
          "I overall enjoyed the course. However, many times there were too many readings assigned for some classes. While the readings were interesting, the length of the articles made it difficult to read the essays in depth. Additionally, the class lectures were a discussion amongst the whole class, which had about 70 people, making it at times difficult to contribute to the discussion. Also, throughout the course, we wrote essays but the final exam was comprehension based, which was quite difficult to prepare for since we have read over 40 articles.",
          "I loved the course- the readings were super interesting and the Professor was amazing.",
          "The tools this course gave me to think about the world and gender and race are invaluable and I use them every day.",
          "I loved this course. I learned about a diverse array of topics relating to feminist thought, and lots of different voices and perspectives were discussed.",
          "dr. nash was the first black professor that ive had at nu and was super excited to take. she leads class in a very efficient manner and truly asks the hard hitting questions that make you think outside of the box. you can tell who her favorites are though which is annoying but thats the only bad thing about the class",
          "TAKE THIS COURSE!!! It's a really amazing course that will make you question a lot of things about society. The readings can stack up on the weekend, but they aren't as hard during the week.",
          "PLEASE get ready to read so much. This class has so much reading to do and it is expected that you do it because the entire class is lecture based. Because almost all of the material was interesting it wasn't hard to read. But you have to put work into this class if you want an A. There are no powerpoints and she takes very vague notes on the board, so you must take good notes and pay attention during class bc this will help a lot with assignments. There are 3 five-page papers and 1 comprehensive final on everything starting from day one. Side note: She doesn't allow technology so you will have to write all of your notes",
          "I really enjoyed this class. The course consists of three 5 page papers that are very manageable and weekly discussion sections with one cumulative final which was not too difficult. Professor Nash opens up the class to discussion which is helpful because it allows the class to cohesively figure out and argue over what each author seems to be discussing in their work. The literature discussed in class was extremely interesting and never horribly long.",
          "Prof. Nash is an incredible professor with lots of insight on the course topic and materials. She really challenges students to explain why they have the opinions they do. She doesn't let you hold any position comfortably/unquestioningly, which makes for great class discussion. She's also a really funny and approachable professor. Class materials were chosen very carefully and were very cohesive/illuminating. Everyone should take a gender studies class (or multiple) and this is a great place to start.",
          "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in gender studies, and even someone who isn't. There are readings assigned every class, which can be a lot sometimes, but they are all very interesting. The class setting is a very good discussion and you really get to dissect the readings and authors. There are 3 papers due and a cumulative final, so not too much. This class will definitely expose you to a variety of viewpoints.",
          "I loved this course first and foremost because Jennifer Nash is an incredible, engaging professor who knows how to facilitate discussion even in a class with upwards of 80 students. The readings felt very focused, interesting, and not excessive. I was willing to put my time and effort into doing the work because I felt like the materials were actually worth learning. I wish we got more feedback on our essays.",
          "This is the BEST class I have taken at Northwestern, and I am nearly positive it will be the best class I will EVER take at Northwestern. The readings are expertly chosen and are organized into very interesting and all-encompassing sections (feminism and the home, the state, sexuality, and the politics of location). This class will change the way you view activism and feminism\u2ffeminists on Northwestern's campus and in the world. It will also challenge the way you view yourself as a feminist, a social activist, and a student at this university. The class is extremely manageable and leaves you with a wealth of information to bring into other classes and disciplines. TAKE THIS CLASS! You will NOT regret it.",
          "Very interesting content but a lot of homework. You have to do all the readings in order to keep up with class discussions.",
          "Really interesting course, I took this for a history distro and we had some great discussions. There is a lot of reading each week and the papers were a bit rough because they weren't like the english papers i was used to writing. Overall still definitely recommend this class",
          "I loved Dr. Nash she is an amazing lecturer. I really appreciated how she connected issues of race with gender and sexuality in this class. Sometimes the texts were long and seemed largely unnecessary, but on the whole very interesting.",
          "I really recommend this class for all students. I was happy to see a diverse group of students taking the course, men and women. I learned a lot in this course and found myself discussing the course material outside of class. This class helped me learn to think of issues in a deeper way.",
          "This course was amazing. I did not know what to expect going into it, but Professor Nash made it engaging, challenging, and fun. There were a lot of people in the class, but it never felt like it was too big to be able to talk and speak your mind.",
          "the reading can pile up, especially since you can get away with participating in class discussion without having read, but try to stay on top of it so you don't have to cram before the final. lectures were very discussion based, which I loved, & discussion section allows you to contribute a bit more since prof nash can't call on everyone during lecture. nash is the best, i really hope i get to take another class with her!",
          "This was an incredible class. Jen is an engaging lecturer and the course materials are super fascinating and well curated. This class challenged me to interact with the world differently and I loved it. The workload was very manageable and was a great survey of feminist thought.",
          "Best course I have ever taken at Northwestern. The TA's and the professor worked very well together to make this class an amazing experience. This course is requires you to think but its about topics that are so relevant and fascinating. The readings were great. I wish could take the class again.",
          "I really enjoyed this class. Though some of the readings are long, all of the readings are interesting and very relevant to the course. The in class discussions were very engaging and helped to explain the texts if any of the texts were confusing. They also related to everyday life which made the discussions even more interesting. Nash was a great teacher and a very enthusiastic and engaging lecturer.",
          "Very interesting and intellectually engaging course, but a LOT of work (about 40 different texts + papers + written, in-class final). The class itself is very thought-provoking and has a great element of discussion and debate for such a large class, but be prepared to spend a ton of time reading rather dense (many legal) texts.",
          "This course is great, but challenging. The entire class is one big discussion, which I loved. You don't want to be on your computer for this class or else you WILL miss something. You have to take notes and pay attention. You also shouldn't miss class because missing one day can make it hard to study for the final. The course had really interesting material and engaging discussion, but it's definitely one that has longer readings and challenging assignments.",
          "Loved this class for its range of readings. The paper topics and class discussions seemed distanced in the sense the paper looked for clarity on subjects that were discussed abstractly in class.",
          "LOVED this class. Professor Nash is wonderful, and I've already recommended this class to so many people.",
          "I was really interested in the intersect of race and gender and this class was great with touching on all intersections in gender studies.",
          "I took this class expecting a more basic introduction to feminist thinking, but I felt like a lot of the material was above my head. The class was essentially 80 minutes of discussion, which I thought would be really cool at first, but it became difficult to follow the conversation sometimes because there wasn't much guidance from Professor Nash. However, I think that if I had focused a bit more and read the texts more closely this wouldn't have been nearly as much of a problem for me. This class requires a lot of reading of difficult texts, but if you don't read, it most likely won't be a problem (she calls on people who don't raise their hands sometimes).",
          "Professor Nash was a wonderful facilitator of discussions and I enjoyed the breadth of the reading list.",
          "I enjoyed reading the historically important texts that inspired the way we think as feminists today and the discussions in class were very constructive and eye opening",
          "Take any class you can with Professor Nash. Superb lecturer, great reading selections.",
          "This course introduced me to new authors and works that I had never heard of before. It forced me to challenge my own beliefs and to really learn what I believe in. Professor Nash was incredible and always kept the class engaged and sought to gain multiple perspectives and ideas. She loved to engage us in debates and pushed us to think deeper about each text. She really tried to know everyone's name and you could tell she cared whether or not we understood what we were learning. She would also make jokes and keep the class super lively. The class was lots of discussion, however, which at times made it difficult to understand the actual text that we read.",
          "Take this course if you are interested in classes that are very much discussion-based. The readings are interesting but very long... there are usually 2 per class. They took me a while to read when I did read them. Jennifer is great, funny and knowledgable. If you are interested in woman's rights and speaking up in class, this may be the class for you. If you aren't big on participating, you might not get much from the class."

          "Really good class. Prof. Ward is very smart and describes himself as \"woke.\" The class is structured pretty well, but there are some components of it that just seem like extra work for no reason (i.e. the journal and the second midterm). It's really interesting subject material, and most readings are of reasonable length. Discussions in class can get a little off-topic, but they're still pretty interesting and engaging.",
          "Handouts are given in each class summarizing the reading, so you don't always need to do it. Professor Ward walks through and explains everything very in-depth. There's only 2 midterms and 2 papers with a few supplementary assignments. It's a pretty easy class and very interesting. You're essentially learning how to be woke.",
          "I did not like all of the various assignments. Way too much writing in this class for a distribution requirement.",
          "There was a ton of reading and most of it was interesting but sometimes it felt like way too much reading because it was all really dense. Classes themselves were kind of boring because if you did the reading carefully all you did in class was talk about it but it was basically just repeating the reading",
          "Interesting topics, but the course was filled with like-minded students who were \"preaching to the choir\". Didn't get to hear much from the other perspectives, so the course was a little dry. Too many tangents from the professor and students",
          "Amazing class. Professor Ward is hilarious. The class felt more like a huge discussion than a lecture. Very interesting content and readings. I had no idea how much gender disparity was present in linguistics, and this class really opened my eyes to many of the issues we have without feeling trivial in any way. There are many readings which are sometimes rather long, and you should plan to at least skim most of them if you want to be successful. There are two midterms, four reaction papers (short 1-2 page papers reacting to assigned readings) of your choice, a journal that you keep up throughout the quarter, a few short homework assignments, and a final paper or presentation.",
          "Found this class really interesting and a really accessible gender studies class (because it's also linguistics so many non gss majors take it). Homework and midterms and mangable and fair. Reading is interesting and classes consist of going through important ideas and quotes from the reading. Professor Ward is fun and an entertaining lecturer.",
          "This class is phenomenal. Professor Ward and his TAs clearly know their material, and they made this class so much fun. I looked forward to lecture and discussion because we talked about real issues that our apart of our everyday lives but in a new, refreshing way. Take this class, take this class, take this class.",
          "Great distro class. Gendered language is relevant to literally everyone and the material was easy to digest. A fair amount of work, especially at the end of the quarter, but never overwhelming. Professor Ward is funny and the lectures are usually pretty interesting.",
          "The class was super interesting and very intellectually stimulating. But by the second half of the course the readings started becoming kind of repetitive.",
          "A very interesting subject combination- class discussions are captivating and the course will affect the ways you view language use by those around you",
          "This course was really interesting, but I wish we could've studied less topics more in depth instead of almost a new topic every week. I loved how we had the option to present in class instead of a final paper/project and I wish all classes provided the same option! Professor Ward is very nice and approachable and presents the concepts in an interesting way, even if we moved very quickly though topics sometimes.",
          "Cool class! Professor Ward is awesome, very funny and a really personable guy. TAs are also generally really good, I had V and they were awesome, great discussion leader. While I did feel like I learned things in this class, a lot of it is somewhat inferrable\u02fcommon knowledge. The first half of the class was the only portion where I really felt I learned concrete concepts; the second half left a lot to be desired and was kinda boring. You don't need to read the readings, just pay attention to the handouts and what's said in class and this should be an easy class.",
          "This class is very interesting but there is a huge liberal bias.",
          "The class provided good discussions on gendered language and expanded my knowledge on this subject.",
          "Great class, learned a lot. Professor Ward is a fun lecturer. You have to do at least the major readings in order to do well, but the study guides help a lot. Second midterm is much harder than the first, but overall not a hard class at all",
          "This course is so so so good and I highly recommend it to truly anyone regardless of academic interest. The content is relatable to anyone and everyone because it deals with the ways that we use language in relation to our gender identity, and so much of what we learned explained tendencies that people may not even notice about themselves. There are a lot of small assignments, but I found them really enjoyable because they made me think about the language people around me use. Studying for the exams wasn't hard either because the content just tends to stick with you because of how fascinating it is.",
          "I learned a lot in this class. There were a lot of readings which were hard to keep track of for midterms, but discussion sections/handouts made the workload more bearable. Class presentations were engaging but erred on the side of too much unrelated discussion.",
          "Highly recommend Language and Gender! Professor Ward is so smart and funny which keeps the class lively. V was also a great TA who clearly cared about their students so take their section if you can. Interesting material, and the kind of class where no one just ends up in because of a bad registration time, so everyone was interested in it. Especially important and topical in the world we live in today. Take this class!",
          "Loved this course, Professor Ward is so well-spoken and great at leading discussion; the work gets a little tedious with the final paper and some of the student-led lectures weren't as good, but overall definitely a course worth taking.",
          "Not great",
          "I loved this class! Gregory is hilarious and so excited about language and gender that it's hard not to be interested in what he has to say. This class makes you reconsider the way you speak and is super relevant to most people's lives and language.",
          "I was very surprised and happy with this class; it was definitely my favorite this quarter. We had large discussions where many people in the class felt comfortable sharing experiences, and we all were able to connect with the content on some level. Professor Ward is hilarious and made the class so enjoyable.",
          "This course was great. It had my attention all quarter long.",
          "This is a great class! Honestly I went into this expecting it to be about trans issues and it was p binary until almost the last lecture but it was still really informative/ fun. Ward goes off on all the tangents which actually made the lectures entertaining instead of annoying, which sometimes tangentially prone profs can get. (Ideally Ward will change the syllabus so the \"questioning the binary lecture\" comes earlier in the quarter but idk)",
          "I really liked the professor who was so passionate about the material. I really liked it too, but it could be a little redundant\u02fcommon sense stuff if you were already socially aware.",
          "Really interesting lectures, easy assignments just stay on top of them",
          "Gender Studies 234 is an exceptional class that I would very much recommend to pretty much anyone at Northwestern. Although I personally am not extremely interested in the subject, I very much see the value in taking such a course and learning about gendered language and how it affects society. This class is not just a class for \"sjw's\" as everyone can benefit from being aware of the history of language and in what context we use it. The lectures are very informal and open for discussion, stories, etc that makes it much more interesting. The materials used in class are youtube videos, etc so they're very accessible. The professor is amazingly relatable and the very pinnacle of \"cool\", would recommend this class.",
          "This was an amazing class! It was a really interesting and relevant topic. The readings were long but they went fast because they were actually fun and thought-provoking. Even the assignments for this class were enjoyable. I didn't know anything about linguistics before I took this class, but the pace was great even for a beginner. Take this class!",
          "great class- amazing class",
          "I entered questioning a linguistic minor and left decided on a linguistics major. Important and enjoyable class!",
          "many pointless readings, not a lot of good discussion in class",
          "The course was great since the Professor was engaged and made it easy for the students to be engaged. The provided reading were very helpful. Despite the class being an hour and 20 minutes, it definitely goes by fast because the topics discussed are so interesting.",
          "Interesting class. Will make you think differently about the way you/other people speak. Lots of reading but most of it is covered in handouts."

          "Amazing course! Was on my senior year bucketlist to take a gender studies course and this one did not disappoint. The entire class is discussion based, Professor Ward is fantastic and provides great insights, but some of the most interesting things I learned were said by other students. It's not that hard either - the midterms were graded extremely fairly and it is really easy to study from the lecture outlines handed out every course. Take this class and learn about the differences between \"girl,\" \"woman\" and \"lady\"!!",
          "You don't just learn in this class; you become \"woke\". This really is a must take course; you will never look at language the same way again.",
          "I loved this class. Professor Ward is knowledgable and passionate, and the TAs were all super. If you go to class, pay attention, and take notes on the daily handouts, the material is easy to handle.",
          "This course is a LOT of work. tons of readings, weekly writing assignments for discussion section, multiple midterms, a big final project, a language journal, and four extra papers throughout the term. that being said, the content is interesting and Prof. Ward is a great lecturer. I\u027d recommend this class if it interests you and you have a lot of free time.",
          "Amazing course it was extremely relevant in our day and age and you actually learn a lot about language and how our ingrained sexism is in our culture and how our culture affects language. Readings were interesting for the most part but the lectures go over the readings so its not super necessary to go to both",
          "everything about this course with Professor Ward is absolutely phenomenal. the articles are interesting to read, handouts very clear - just show up to class and discussion and youll do fine on the midterm. very interesting intersection between linguistics and gender studies.",
          "Overall, the content was interesting as gendered nature of linguistic differences were examined through various studies and theories. However, having separate sets of reading and homework assignments for the discussion sections did not really provide additional materials that were beneficial for the course. Readings for the class were rarely covered in full detail during lectures.",
          "I think this course isn't particularly stimulating. The tests are reasonably easy (second midterm harder) and the discussion sections were good, however, most of the material covered was either common sense or completely redundant. I think the class environment was very \"group-think\" like in the sense that no one ever voiced opinions contradictory to the direction of the discussion taking place. Personally, I wouldn't recommend the course unless you have personal interest or want a (relatively) easy A.",
          "Took this class for fun. It was still a lot of work (weekly writing assignments and readings), but this class was really interesting.",
          "A good class that has a very interesting topic. Lecture can sometimes be repetitive but the class is very interactive and allows you to talk about your own opinion of the topics.",
          "Professor Ward is an incredibly engaging professor, and I really loved this class.",
          "This is a good class to take because it makes you more aware of your language use and how to be more responsible with your word choice. Very easy class. Readings are pretty easy, as are the midterms, papers, and projects. Lectures were really engaging and although it got a bit repetitive, I still learned a lot of valuable stuff. Would recommend this class.",
          "Was sad that the class focused mainly on the two binary genders, but I became more aware of everyday gendered language.",
          "this class is rad as hell, prof. ward is very chill and funny and smart. mostly lecture but also a lot of robust discussion that felt unusual for a class this size. readings can be kind of long and dense, but if you go to class they make sense",
          "This course opened my eyes to so many gender inequalities that take place in everyday conversation! It gave me the awareness and the tools to analyze these inequalities, and recognize them and have conversations about them. I talked with my friends about this class a lot and what I was learning from it, because it was all so applicable. fair warning: lectures can be dry and boring. It functions as a big class discussion for the most part but it's often dominated by only a few people speaking, and it sometimes just gets pretty mundane. The student presentations are great--do it if you have the opportunity! You'll thank yourself later when you don't have to write the final paper. Overall, you learn really interesting things but truly...lecture is boring and that's not something to overlook when you are going to this class twice a week for ten weeks.",
          "This is an AMAZING course. Very interesting, phenomenal professor that keeps the class engaged and creates great discussion. My favorite class I've taken thus far. Highly recommended to anyone looking for an easy distro",
          "Ward is an awesome professor who made the class really fun. The HW was extremely manageable and easy. 2 Midterms and both were very straightforward.",
          "I'm a feminist, but this class was intense. If you're enrolled for the \"Language\" part, expect so much more of the \"Gender\" part. Discussions in class could be interesting, but included a lot of preaching to the choir--not much learning going on. There was a short paper (1.5 to 2 pages) due every discussion section. Two midterms and an 8- to 10-page paper due finals week (unless you did a class presentation instead). Course wasn't bad, but somewhat subjective, work intensive, and completely erased any thoughts I had previously had of exploring a Gender Studies major. Gregory Ward is a great professor though, very engaging and informed (and--as the kids say these days--\"woke\").",
          "A lot of work, especially writing. Have to conduct own research paper at end. Papers due every week in addition to more papers due intermittently. Was interesting material and learned a lot. However, if looking for an easy distro, look elsewhere.",
          "This is a really interesting class and Ward is a good prof but there are a lot of busy work assignments that take up a lot of time",
          "This course made me be more conscious of my language. It was more work than I anticipated (1 or 2 pages of homework a week, 4 short papers throughout the quarter, and a research paper at the end), and the readings were incredibly long, but it is the most interesting class I've taken at Northwestern. Very good introduction for a gender studies course if you're a bit hesitant. Loved gregory. Very funny",
          "Honestly, if you're not super interested in the intersection between language and gender, consider not taking this class. Professor Ward is wonderful, but there are four reaction papers, weekly homework assignments, a comprehensive journal, a final project or paper and two midterms. There's the option to do a presentation instead of the final paper: TAKE THIS OPTION. Very worth it. Lots of work in this class I came very close to withdrawing.",
          "This course is fun and not too work-heavy, however the texts are redundant and not always so interesting",
          "This is the first linguistics/gender class I've ever taken, and I'm so happy I did because it is probably one of my favorite classes this quarter. The material was compelling, the discussions were animated, relevant, and up-to-date, and there always seemed to be the perfect balance between the time spent lecturing and the time spent discussing. The one thing I will say, though, is there is a lot of reading and you will crash and burn on the midterms if you fall behind. There are a lot of writing assignments that run parallel to what you need to read for lecture, so you've got to stay on top of it, but if you do it's really rewarding!",
          "This course was really fun and interesting. All of the information in the readings were in his packets which made everything really accessible. Professor Ward is a really funny and entertaining person and I hope I get to take more of his classes in the future.",
          "This class was interesting, but the weekly homeworks were a LOT of work for something that was only part of a participation grade. I was taking 2 upper-level STEM classes, and this 200-level linguistics class took more of my time than those two, combined. There is a lot of reading assigned but you definitely don't need to do all of it. Classes are mostly big discussions, and it's a lot of Woke 101, yet at the same time it operates almost exclusively with a gender-binary view...except for the last lecture which says \"hmmm maybe the gender binary isn't real?\" Still, you can use this class (especially the journal assignment) to become much more aware of gendered language, which is important in virtually every possible field.",
          "VERY AWESOME CLASS!!! This class completely blew my mind and gave me so much to talk and think about with literally everyone around me. I feel smarter and more capable of understanding the world and myself because of this class. Greg is so positive (sometimes a little too excited so he speaks over other people who are supposed to be leading the class on that day), and he totally gets everyone amped up about linguistics. TAKE THIS CLASS",
          "This class is great if you are at all interested or passionate about issues with gender and language. Professor Ward is a great lecturer and I found the subject matter to be fascinating, especially in the second half of the class.",
          "This class is awesome! Professor Ward is engaging and extremely knowledgeable. The readings are usually fairly short and well covered in class. Everything that was talked about was very interesting and really makes you think about the way we speak. This course has a very distinct impact on my day-to-day life and was extremely enjoyable.",
          "copied and pasted from the last question. this course sucks. its the biggest circle jerk of a class, absolutely pointless. the only thing i learned is that society is sexist (wow, what a shocker!). the entire class is complaining about issues without talking about actual solutions. and god forbid you try to point out that perhaps something isnt a gendered issue, you are WRONG. absolute bullshit. its disappointing, because this class could have been so good... its a distro requirement for me, but it had super good CTECs and people said its an easy A (theyre not exactly wrong on that-- its a lot of assignments, but you can bullshit them easily). but the main reason i took it was because it sounded interesting, and its not. i usually would go to class to get the note packets and then sneak out the backdoor because it was just mind numbingly dull.",
          "THe material is fairly easy, however, I thought the TA grading was much harder than necessary at times.",
          "This class was overall great. There is a Lot of 1-2 page writing homeworks, at least one per week. The material is interesting, although the readings and lecture are redundant. Lecture was most interesting for the discussion that arose with students concerning the material.",
          "So much reading. Literally all class is is talking about the readings. They are interesting and relevant but many many pages. Hope you have a good TA because they all grade differently and your grade is too dependent on their subjective standards.",

          "The class was absolutely incredible, especially if you are interested in the HIV\u02faIDS epidemic. I took this class just out of interest and it exceeded my expectations. Aaron is an absolutely incredible teacher and I highly recommend taking one of his classes. He is so much fun and very interested in his work which makes the class so much more enjoyable. The workload is not too bad, just a lot of reading, but it all is extremely useful when it comes to the final essay and midterm essay. There are no tests which is great, and the material is not too challenging but definitely requires a lot of time and analysis to fully grasp all the concepts. In terms of weekly work there is reading each week and one reading response with a couple questions (not too challenging, you just need to do the reading to be able to do these) but other than that no other homework or work! Highly recommend taking!",
          "This is one of my favorite courses I've taken at NU. The course material is really interesting, and the class was super engaged. We had great discussions, where it was easy to get participation points in. It is worth it to show up to every class because Aaron's lectures are great. Overall a really good class with a lot of informative topics that everybody should know.",
          "Aaron Norton is fantastic! I learned so much in this class through both articles and class time. Aaron made every class interesting and open.",
          "The structure of this course was perfect for the material. I loved the weekly reading responses because it encouraged and ensured that students (myself included) would read and be able to contribute to class discussion. The two papers were way better at helping us synthesize theories than any exam would be. The professor encouraged a level of discussion that was not only appropriate for the subject matter but also for the level of the course. Based on this and the subject matter -- which encouraged analytical thinking and a high level of openness -- was one of my favorites at Northwestern.",
          "This course was very well taught and Aaron is a great professor who is passionate and very knowledgable about this issue. The weekly readings can be long but they are also extremely interesting so they go by really fast. In class discussions were very engaging and it challenged me to think about the HIV epidemic in ways that I never thought about before, in addition to challenging me to think differently about the issue as it exists today. This was one of my favorite discussion-based courses at Northwestern thus far.",
          "I loved this course, readings were really interesting and Aaron is an amazing and very kind and understanding professor. This really expanded my way of thinking.",
          "Great class with a great prof, not a ton of work with two papers and weekly reading summaries. Really interesting material highly recommend",
          "This is an excellent course that really gives you a complete picture of the history of HIV\u02faIDS and the current state of HIV\u02faIDS. The reading is not too heavy and is for the most part super interesting. The course taught me the value that can be found in interrogating the moralism and bias that exists within science and the medical field, and it gave me a very good idea of how HIV\u02faIDS is still impacting the world today. The course makes a conscious effort to not focus at all on the gay, white male story of HIV\u02faIDS and stresses the importance of looking at the epidemic in populations of colors, trans communities, and heterosexual couples. Like any good gender/sexuality studies course, the class also challenges conventional beliefs about sex and gender. If you are looking for a great GSS course, TAKE THIS CLASS!",
          "This is by far one of the best classes I have taken at Northwestern. Professor Norton is such a great person and so knowledgable about the content he is teaching. The readings are very interesting and the assignments are pretty manageable.",
          "This was an incredible class to take this quarter. Aaron did a great job of balancing lecture and discussion and was very clear about grading\u02fassignments. The content of the course was very informative and opened my eyes to a lot of public health issues that are occurring today.",
          "This class is incredibly well done and organized--you learn a lot in a not stressful way",
          "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Northwestern. I recommend this class, even if you aren't interested in AIDS/HIV.",
          "I loved this class. Although it is a lot of work, with weekly reading responses due every Sunday and two essays, it is worth it. I feel like I have learned a lot and this has been one of my favorite classes at Northwestern. I highly recommend taking it even if you are not interesting in health/gender studies. It is a good way to learn about human nature and behavior."

          "The course was really a discussion section twice a week. The readings were interesting but unless you're really intrigued by the subject, don't take this course. It can get boring quickly if you're not interested.",
          "The course provided solid textual and academic support to back theories and principles I found myself already familiar with. Overall, this course sparked major introspection into my own ambitions and curiosities, while promoting various perspectives and voices.",
          "Really interesting course! As a gender studies course I struggled to understand and follow sometimes, but as an English course I really enjoyed close-reading the material.",
          "This class is awesome. Professor Roth is super fun to work with and she has a lot of knowledge about reproduction in general. The readings and workload in general are very manageable. I think everyone should take a class about reproduction that does not focus only on abortion. Overall, a great class, I highly recommend.",
          "This is my favorite class that I have taken thus far at Northwestern, which is shocking considering that until now, I have always hated English classes. The course is so interesting, so well taught, the sources are current and actually fun to read (popular media, contemporary narratives, etc.), and Sarah Roth is AMAZING. HIGHLY recommend.",
          "LOVE LOVE LOVED this class. I learned so much about a topic that is not analyzed enough. The papers weren't too hard and Professor Roth is great!",
          "I loved the course content and the emphasis on marginalized reproduction. Sarah Roth is a passionate professor, and is very willing to talk to and work with students based on their interests and challenges. She cares about student understanding of the material, and broader academia, as well as their understanding of her own points of view and experiences. Occasionally, the class discussion became very white and very cisgender, but the professor was willing to acknowledge and address this. She was transparent with her own struggles to and emphasis on marginalized reproductive experiences.",
          "This class is mainly discussion based. It's most helpful to complete the readings by Monday, rather than spreading them across Monday and Wednesday class periods (as suggested by the professor).",
          "Prof. Roth is amazing - she really cares about her students and helps to facilitate interesting debate in class. that being said, the course themes got really repetitive during the second half of the quarter and I felt like we were re-learning the same things with slightly different spins on them for the last few weeks"

I thought it would be more focused on new technologies in reproduction and it was more about how culture defines family\u02fchildren/reproduction. I did not think it was too much work, although we ended up missing one of the classes and only had to write 2 short papers instead of the usual 3.",
          "Well this was an interesting course, I was a bit disappointed in the lack of actual content pertaining to reproduction or birth. Quite a bit of the content was about marriage and kinship ties and I was hoping there would be a bit more on the medical side of anthropology and more on the evolution of childbirth.",
          "This three hour class was really hard for me to get through. The discussion never flowed well enough for me to catch on. We had to read about four books. The whole grade depended on the final research paper which did not have a clear outline. The professor did make an effort to assist in formulating a good topic for the final paper. However, I found her to be very critical of ideas brought up in class that made it difficult for me to feel included or willing to participate.",
          "The content of this course has the potential to be really interesting, but because of the professor and the way it's taught, it feels like a waste of time. You can take this if you need it for anthro major - it's not too much work - but I would not recommend it. Also, professor makes racist microaggressions in class.",

So wildly interesting and though provoking. Professor Partridge is a delight. She is kind and caring and wants her students to learn and understand. She is very helpful in office hours when it comes to the papers. She is a relatively easy grader but the papers require use of primary sources as well as class texts. Learning about health based social movements was so interesting and the discussions she facilitated in class were as well.",
          "This was such a good class. Amy is such a good instructor and she put together a fascinating set of course materials that created a great theoretical and historical sense of health activism. I loved going to class each day and would highly recommend taking a class with Amy!",
          "I loved this class. I always felt challenged but that I could ask questions when I didn't understand something. Sometimes there was a lot of material to read or watch before the next class, but it was never busy work. Every assignment we had helped us in some way to understand the material further. Professor Partridge is really amazing and I learned so much in this class.",

          "Really interesting course, very intellectually challenging. Weekly reading response and 2 essays. Requires a considerable amount of time to do the readings and think critically enough about them to meaningfully contribute to class, but worth it. Important course for global health people!",
          "Aaron is awesome and the class is challengingly interesting. If you're remotely interested in medicine and social science this is a great class to understand how they interact",
          "Professor Norton is so passionate about this topic and well-versed. He makes it a well-rounded learning experience so that students can see HIV\u02faIDS from several different angles. While this course was interesting, it can be a bit overwhelming for students who cannot handle the sensitive topic or cannot appreciate student opinions on this very real subject matter. Overall, phenomenal class for gender studies and premed students.",
          "Aaron is the best and this class is so incredibly interesting. Having come into the class already interested in the topic, it provides not only a great baseline of things to know, but delves into so many different aspects of the epidemic. While classes once in a while were a little dry, the majority of the time the information was extremely stimulating and Aaron finds fun ways to cover the material despite being lecture based. The readings were interesting and, although the reading responses took a long time, they ended up helping for the midterm and final essays. Overall, great class and highly recommend taking with Aaron if possible!",
          "The professor was understanding, accessible, and very very excited about the course, which made all the students eager to join",
          "I really like this class. I felt that I didn't know enough about HIV so I decided to take it and I feel like I learned so much about HIV and biomedicine, biases in research, etc. There's not too much work, the material is interesting, and Prof Norton was great. I\u027d really recommend taking the class!",
          "This class is really conceptually challenging but so so worth it. The readings are dense and oftentimes contradict our assumptions about sexual health and the HIV\u02faIDS epidemic, but the weekly reading responses really give you a chance to pull them apart and make sure you understand them. Professor Norton is really approachable and a great lecturer. He often comments that he feels like he's talking too much, but in reality he does a great job of making time for class discussion and comments.",

          "I really wanted to love this class. Aaron is lovely, and I love sociology and biomedicine. Still, it didn't quite keep me engaged. Without a discussion section, the class is all lectures done in the same format which can get old. The reading responses every week were good at forcing me to read but felt a little obsessive. I found both papers (midterm and final) extremely difficult. The prompts are vague yet specific and the TA had crazy parameters for what was \"good writing\". Overall, I loved the material of the class but not the way it was taught.",
          "Great course. Aaron is a super nice guy, and knows a lot about the material. Lots of reading, and lectures can get a bit dry at times, but for the most part very interesting course and Aaron does a nice job of making time for discussion and questions. He lets students focus on the topics that interest them but also knows which ideas/issues are the most engaging\u2fbest for students to discuss and grapple with.

I wish the class had been more intersectional, because I felt like a lot of what we talked about wasn't representative of all women's experience in the workplace. Overall, it was an easy class, but I don't think students got a lot out of it in terms of developing a new understanding of gender dynamics.",

Orloff was a great professor to have this class with because she's so experienced and knowledgeable in the subject and really communicated concepts well to students. Exam was very fair and I actually enjoyed writing the essays that they called for (but be prepared, it takes a lot of time and thought and should definitely be started as soon as you get the exam questions). Format of the class is mainly lectures and discussions with really great videos/movies here and there. One large take-home exam, shorter final paper, and weekly blogs. Overall really loved this course and the content that I learned from it!! I know it'll shape my view of the workplace and its place in life for the rest of my future.",

          "Dr. Watkins-Hayes is amazing. Take this class if you can! There are a lot of really interesting readings, great discussion, and she really cares about the group dynamic in a way that makes the material so engaging. Such an important course to take.",
          "Loved this class. I learned so much both from professor Watkins-Hayes and my peers. I was exposed to perspectives of students I had never considered or heard before. If you do the readings class discussions are enriching and interesting. However, if you miss a reading it is not a big deal. There is a decent amount of work in this class, but there are various extra credit assignments that allow you to boost your grade.",
          "Great class. Teaches students how to use analytical intersectional frameworks to look at issues; the biological cannot be divorce from the social. TAs were enthusiastic and helpful, and Professor Watkin-Hayes is an absolute gem. Take this class!",
          "I really enjoyed this class. The energy in the class isn't stale or dry and if you take this class for your major (aka not for distro requirement), the topics discussed will keep you engaged. The materials in the class are great and splitting homework between text and film made it less tedious to complete. With Professor Watkins-Hayes, the homework is just two response papers, a group presentation, and a final paper, all which you can design your schedule yourself. Great for distributing work load based on other courses",
          "Amazing class, I feel like I really have gained a vocabulary\u02fframework for talking about not just HIV\u02faIDS, but inequality in general. Watkins-Hayes is a great prof!!",
          "Take this class!! This was one of my favorite sociology classes and Professor Watkins-Hayes is amazing. She is really engaging in class and each lecture is focused on new and interesting information.",
          "This course was without a doubt one of my favorites at Northwestern! Amazing organization of class structure and materials by Professor Watkins-Hayes!",
          "Very strong class! Professor Watkins Hayes is a very engaging/intelligent professor who knows how to teach. If this year is any indication, she also has a knack for finding good TAs. Would recommend."

          "This was easily one of the best classes I've taken. Prof Thakor was so engaging and really pushed students to think differently about the material. Also she was one of the most knowledgeable professors, who could always deliver complex material in a clear and understandable way. She was always approachable, helpful, and thoughtful. I would recommend this class or any of prof Thakor's classes to anyone!",
          "I LOVED THIS COURSE!! So topical to what is going on around us today, and Mitali is SUCH a great and engaging professor. This is her first year here but she is one of the best professors I've ever had. I am not even taking this class for a requirement, but am so glad I took it. I would recommend this to anyone, regardless of major.",
          "Professor Thakor is one of the most engaging professors I've had at Northwestern. This topic is super critical to engaging with in contemporary times. Overall structure of the class is amazing, and it was so fun to attend this class. I could not get enough!",
          "Don't leave Northwestern without taking a class with Prof. Thakor ! One of the most passionate, knowledgeable, and caring professors I've had at NU. This class in particular helped me think more critically about migrant labor, human rights, and global gender/sex regimes. A good balance of anthropological/sociological theory, art, and primary sources."

          "Overall I felt that the course was not very challenging, nor very interesting. Professor D'Onofrio was very helpful and engaging.",
          "This class is the best class I've taken so far here at NU. Honestly, with all my STEM classes it was really nice to have this nice, easier class to go to. The workload is minimal, and if you're juggling Bio and Orgo in the same quarter it's a blessing. The material is really interesting too, and good for a first Linguistics class. There is an experimental requirement, but only 2 experiments (2 hours). Annette is the best! Seriously, she's so chill and an amazing professor.",
          "One of my favorite courses at NU! It's a relatively easy course, but all the material is very applicable and interesting. D'Onofrio is so engaging and approachable!",
          "interesting class but hard graders",
          "Great distro!! Annette is so cute and I loved her.",
          "This was a great class! Annette is the coolest, and she really knows her stuff. The material is very engaging and relevant to current society. After taking this class, I look at language use (mine and others') differently and I think knowledge of sociolinguistics is an important part of an education for anybody who is interested in social justice or social policy.",
          "This was a pretty easy course. There was not a lot of work, and I got to learn a lot about how language and society interact.",
          "This course is interesting because you truly understand the role of language in society and how sociolinguistic variables index certain social meanings that can explain why society has these views. It isn't too time consuming on a weekly basis with only about 50 pages of reading a week and a two-paragraph reading response every week. The linguistic analysis were interesting and something I had never done before. The Quantitative Data Analysis Assignment was specifically difficult because it is the first one and you dont really know what they are looking for. The next one is on Style and is much easier. The final paper is difficult and took a very long time but overall the course was fine.",
          "This course is very interesting and Prof is really good at filling the time so, although it's a long lecture-style class, it almost never drags. I definitely recommend doing the readings over the weekend before they're due because the 5:00 deadline is easy to forget about until the day of and 30 pages is too much to cram. The class is really what you make it but Annette is engaging and is quite reasonable with the assignment expectations.",
          "Not only was this class informative, it was also a lot of fun. The class discussions were intriguing and provided a lot of perspective on language that I wouldn't have had otherwise, and the assignments helped me learn a lot about how to write research papers.",
          "The class felt more like a large discussion period with some academic material rather than a lecture, which made it super enjoyable. If you're interested in anything related to sociology and curious into how linguistics plays a role- definitely take this class. Assignments are all super doable and the 2 papers during the quarter (including the final paper) are as well.",
          "This class was great. Prof. D'Onofrio is really nice and excited to teach. This class is really easy, one paragraph reading response a week. Two midterm essays and one final essay. Interesting subject matter.",
          "I loved this course. I took this class for fun and it did not disappoint. Professor D'Onofrio is great.",
          "Really great class, interesting topics, cool professor, and great discussions about relevant topics regarding language as an identity marker for age, race, gender, orientation, social class, etc.",
          "I LOVED this class. The readings were engaging, the lectures were interesting, and the professor is great! It's eye-opening to look at how language affects society and vice versa, and I recommend this class to everyone. The projects and papers we had to do took a bit of time but were worth it because they were so cool and not ordinary research papers.",
          "I believe that the course helped me observe linguistic phenomenon in a new light, exposing me to issues that I hadn't considered before from both a linguistic and social view point. The instruction in the class was done very well, and I learned a lot from both the readings and the class lectures.",
          "Incredibly easy and still interesting. Gets repetitive, but D'Onofrio is a gem. I wouldn't take this class if she wasn't teaching it, but if she is, I\u027d say this is a fun, easy distro.",
          "A solid course. Well taught and interesting material. Workload not bad",
          "If you have any interest in linguistics take this class!! It's not a heavy workload although the projects can be time consuming. Most of the readings were enjoyable and supplemented what we talked about in class. Annette is a great professor!",
          "This course gave me a much deeper understanding of some topics I knew a little about already, and raises some very interesting points on social justice concerns.",
          "I definitely recommend this course if you are at all interested in the way people talk, because it is very cool to see a linguistic explanation of why people talk the way they do.",
          "This class was somewhat interesting and not that challenging. I thought the readings and the materials that had to do with society today were interesting, but some of the other materials were dense and boring. Overall, an easy distro that doesn't require prior knowledge on the subject.",
          "Annette is a great Professor! Passionate about linguistics and makes class interesting and fun."

The handouts do help out a lot in giving examples, many of which are explained during class. I do recommend this class for a distribution requirement, as it is not exactly easy, still challenging, but still easy enough to get through it without worrying to much about homework load and time needed to complete it.",
          "Was not excited to take this class as am not a math person but it was completely manageable and I feel like I learned a lot. The only annoying part of the class is that you have to turn assignments in through a computer, you can't turn in any form of hand written work and that is annoying when you have to make a ton of trees that can be very time consuming .",
          "It was an okay distro for formal studies. You have to be prepared to actually go to class and put a lot of time into the assignments, but thankfully there weren't a lot of them.",
          "go to lecture!! even though it is super boring you need to go to lecture to do well on the four take home assignments and take home final.",
          "Not a good class. Went in interested in exploring a new area, but was just disappointed. Would not recommend.",
          "Interesting course overall. I took it as a distro and enjoyed it. Masaya is a good teacher, and you don't need a book for his class which is a big plus.",
          "This class was really interesting, with a lot of cool material that will blow your mind a little bit because it's stuff you would never think about on your own. Masaya is great, and he makes lecture fun with all his bad jokes. He's also amazing at explaining things in different ways for people who don't understand them and has never-ending patience in his willingness to explain. Read the handouts he posts on Canvas BEFORE class, and everything will make much more sense; even if you don't understand it in writing, the professor will explain it and you'll be less confused because you at least primed yourself for the info.",
          "The material was interesting, but the course felt disorganized and some of the homework assignments were unreasonably hard.",
          "Although this class is interesting, I would not recommend taking it under any circumstances unless the homework format is changed. Masaya only accepts computer drawn word trees that take hours to create, even when the conceptual work is straightforward. It's an enormous waste of time on a class that I actually would have enjoyed otherwise.",
          "It was a casual and easy distribution requirement, I have gotten nothing out of it.",
          "I liked Professor Masaya, and he did his best to explain each topic to us. He would ask us repeatedly if we understood before moving on to a new topic. However, by the end of the term, everything had gotten very, very complicated, and it's really easy to make small mistakes on the homework and exam that add up to a lot of missed points. I liked the lecture, but the last two homework assignments and the exam were very difficult.",
          "not as easy as expected",
          "The content got really confusing a lot of times, and the professor was not really helpful in the class. I found self-studying via handouts and the text book more effective. It was good to have all the assignments taken home, but they were extremely time-consuming and emotionally exhausting.",
          "tree diagrams are awful but this class is pretty cool. Masaya is super cool and a great professor. the English language is trippy, y\u027all.",
          "The course only gets challenging towards the end -- the last homework assignment (before the final) took me nearly 10 hours, but most others took me closer to 3 or 4. The most time-filling part of this class is making all those trees. The subject is not inherently interesting, but Yoshida is engaging and it fills a distribution requirement.",
          "It seems really easy for the first half of the quarter, but the last homework and the final are pretty difficult. Masaya is a fun teacher, but so much of the class is spent answering student questions that aren't that helpful. You don't have to go to all the lectures.",
          "Really interesting class, but not an easy distro at all. Take it if you think you can handle taking a more scientific approach to language, not if you're looking to improve on your English skills.",
          "I took this course as a Math/Science distro. It started off fine but then I would just get bored in class and zone out. The homeworks, although there are few, probably took me over 12 hours to complete. Each tree drawing took me 30-40 minutes to draw. The last homework was the worst. I never will use this learning in my everyday life so I am not too stressed about it.",
          "Masaya is a KOOKY guy but also a really fun lecturer. I have never been in a room of so many confused people that are also still interested in what the lecturer is saying. Except for the guy that sat in front of me every day and wrote a novel on his computer. It's not a bad plot, tbh.",
          "It was near impossible to learn anything in this class as the class time was exceptionally tedious. At first the homework was very simple and could be completed just by looking at the additional handouts, the fourth homework assignment completely out of left field and literally took me twelve hours to complete. It was also due the Saturday of thanksgiving break. I really struggled to understand the latter half of this course.",
          "I wish there would have been a book or source to reference other than a somewhat-jumbled course pack.",
          "Daunting homework assignments, but reasonable experiment requirements.",
          "If you're not a math person, this is the perfect class for a formal studies distro. 4 homework assignments, no midterm, and take home final",
          "This was an extremely frustrating course for me. This may just have been my case, but I had a very hard time understanding the concepts taught in the class. Masaya is a nice and funny professor, and maybe other students knew what they were doing, but after attending all the lectures, taking pages of notes, and attending both TA's office hours, I still had no clue what was going on and felt stressed out and frustrated while doing each homework assignment.",
          "Honestly, I forgot I was taking this class most of the time. There was so little work to do outside of class. I found most classes to be slow and got bored, but I know other people really enjoyed the pace.",
          "I learned that language highly relied on its structures. The class was more like exploring different language phenomena together than listening to a lecture.",
          "All of the assignments were take-home, including the final, which I found convenient. The online handouts were very useful in completing the homeworks but I would definitely recommend attending and taking notes during the lectures in order to get the most out of the course.",
          "I'm interested in linguistics, so I appreciated the discussions on sentence and word formation. I felt like what we were doing was solving logic puzzles the whole time, and, if that's not your thing, I\u027d take a pass on this class. Some of the concepts are difficult to grasp if you've never thought about things like \"why is language the way it is?\"",
          "I will not be taking a linguistics course again because it is really confusing and unnecessary, but I enjoyed it to an extent. Masaya is super cool and you will get lost if you don't go to lecture, so it's definitely worth coming to class.",
          "Straightforward course - there's nothing unexpected on the homework or final. Notes are given out at the start of the course and Prof goes over all of them in the lectures. Notes are good but not extensive, so go to office hours. This class is easy if you put in the effort and attend the lectures.",
          "The lectures were informative and well structured. However, I was frustrated that the material taught was not founded in concrete, current materials. This made it difficult to research\u02fexpand upon what was taught in class outside of class. Overall, a great intro class for anybody interested in linguistics.",
          "Lectures were so bad. Could not see where anything was going at all. Notes provided on canvas were virtually no help. Impossible to follow what they mean.",
          "I enjoyed this course. However, I think that had more to do with the professor than the course content and structure, and I will say that the last two homework assignments were probably the most difficult assignments I've ever done. Also please please PLEASE let students turn in tree diagrams on paper!!! I cannot say this enough: I think the homework assignments would have taken half the time if we were allowed to hand-draw tree diagrams.",
          "I thought this was a very interesting class which was extremely important for an understanding of linguistics.",
          "There were days I really enjoyed this class and felt like I was learning a lot, and there were days when I didn't like it as much and thought the instruction could have been clearer. It was a good distribution requirement that was for the most part not too hard, but I do not think I will take more linguistics classes.",
          "This course was frustrating. The instructional materials were a bit difficult to follow. The class didn't seem to follow a clear structure which made the content more difficult to understand.",
          "The class was pretty technical but, overall, you can get by on the class notes.",
          "I did not enjoy this course. I came in interested in linguistics but left hating it.",
          "Extremely interesting course - didn't know much about Linguistics beforehand but learned a lot. Masaya was a fantastic prof and him and the TAs explained key concepts well. Only a few assignments due, but they are time consuming so don't wait until the last minute. The first few weeks of the course may give you a false sense of security but there's definitely a difficulty spike around the halfway point where a lot of people wind up dropping. As long as you go to class and take notes you should be able to keep up, though.",
          "I hated this class so much. Really REALLy uninteresting like painfully boring and has no application in the real world, which they tell you at the beginning but still. Masaya is funny but unhelpful in answering questions. Always has too much going on on the board and poses questions that NEVER get answered. So boring, sososo sBORING, boring",
          "pretty interesting goes into enough depth for an intro class professor great",
          "This was a pretty solid class - a lot harder than I was expecting because apparently he had to make it not an easy A class this year, but it was okay. The lectures were all on a chalkboard/no powerpoint involved which was a bit of an adjustment but I got used to it okay, and he provided lecture packets which were clutch. I would 11\u2f10 recommend going to class because a lot of the HW questions he actually did in class. A bit boring, but Masaya was relatively entertaining when he wanted to be. The overall structure was 4 assignments and a take home final. The first two were pretty easy; the last 2 and the final were ROUGH so I would recommend starting those early and going to office hours because office hours were the only reason I did well in this class. Go to the TAs' office hours!!!!!!!",
          "There wasn't a ton of work, but the homework were difficult to complete because of how disorganized and unclear the lectures were. Meeting with TAs was helpful, but homework assignments took inordinate amounts of time because of how long it takes to make sentence trees on the computer.",
          "I had no prior knowledge about what linguistics was or how to study it, and I was hoping this class would gauge my interest in the course. The study of why grammar functions the way it does was pretty interesting, but I needed an engaging teacher to help me, and I assume, other individuals unfamiliar with the subject, with the material. I did not get that - I can tell the professor understands linguistics and gets a grasp on it, but his explanations to the class were presented in a very broken and confusing manner. Oftentimes, it was not clear what he was saying or trying to explain, and I could tell the class was scared to ask clarifying questions for fear of further confusion. The only thing driving me to complete the course at the end of the quarter was to be done with the distribution requirement.",
          "A fine lecture but terrible presentation of content especially in the homework.",
          "Would not recommend this course with this instructor. He is clearly brilliant, but the topics are confusing under the best of circumstances, and his course materials are often unreadable due to their poor syntax even to the point that the written handouts give incorrect instruction. In addition, the few (very confusingly formatted and worded) assignments are graded without sufficient time or information provided for students to learn from what they got wrong.",
          "Okay so: I never went to class. Except the first day. And so honestly, yeah you can get by the quarter without going. BUT be forewarned- the lecture notes are not comprehensive at all (and a lot of times actually it has errors). So you're going to have to supplement your at home learning with videos etc. idk how I did the final but I definitely felt myself wishing I\u027d gone to class the last half of quarter and also taken good notes Bc apparently a lot of the hw/ final examples are written out in class. So is this an easy A? No freaking way (unless there is a curve). But can you get an easy A-\u02fb+ ? For sure- if you're willing to teach yourself material and GO TO OFFICE HOURS. You can't skip class and not go to OH if you want a great grade.",
          "A low stress class that does teach some nice fundamentals of setence trees.",
          "The course was alright, I just found the content extremely boring and unexciting, which made it hard for me to do well.",
          "This course started off okay. The lectures were fairly boring but I'm here for a distro credit so, no harm done there. Prof Yoshida is a funny guy, but there's only so much you can do to liven up word/sentence structure. Things started to go sideways when it came time to do the assignments. IGNORE ALL CTECS SAYING YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO LECTURE. They changed the course content to make it harder and if you blow off lecture you will be screwed six ways to Sunday. Why? Because the notes posted online have gigantic content gaps in them, and what is posted is not always the easiest thing to decipher. Simply put: everything that's due for the class is posted on day one, but you will not do well on the later assignments/the final if you fail to attend lecture. Not to mention that they will take you hours to complete. This is definitely not the easy A it apparently once was.",
          "Super interesting class, time-consuming homework.",
          "The material was relatively interesting, but the professor doesn't explain the concepts very well, and the course packets he gave out were unclear. However, the workload was fair, and as long as you keep up, you'll do fine.",
          "This course was interesting. It really helps you to think about language in a different way. If you go to the lectures, the material is all very doable and logical. The professor genuinely wants to help students understand the material and will always answer any questions you have!! This is a great class to take if you're somewhat interested in linguistics or want to learn more about how it works.",
          "The beginning of this course is easy and the first few homework were not bad at all. However, around week 6 or 7, the course got impossibly difficult and the problems that were done in class and in the notes did not match the homework problems at all.",
          "Very hard, really difficult to understand materials, unorganized, and not practical or intuitive at all. The only saving grace is Professor Masaya, he's hilarious and very smart but there is little to no support to learn the material.",
          "This class could get pretty dreary at times, but it is important to go to class and take notes because a lot of the trees he draws in class are very helpful in answering the homework questions. I'm not sure how helpful recording would be. It is SOO important to stay current on the worksheets and make sure you understand them because they are basically all you need to answer homework and they are very helpful (maybe even more than the lecture) in making you understand the logical flow of arguments he uses to build up concepts. Apart from this, this class is pretty non-stressful. All your grade is just take home assignments.",

          "Leddon is AWESOME I loved this class because the content was interesting, and she always found a way to bring it back to current day events",
          "A very thought provoking and useful course",
          "I really enjoyed this class! never taken a linguistics but that is absolutely not necessary for this class. Erin is a great professor. Quizzes and exams are very straightforward. Lectures were not too bad. i actually enjoyed going to this class!",
          "It's a great class with an AMAZING professor, but there are some drawbacks. There are too many readings -- you can get by with just skimming them though. Realistically by the end I wasn't doing readings and just studying powerpoints. That seemed sufficient for at least a B+\u02fa-. It helps to just have a basic understanding of prejudice before (like from PA training or something). The format is one midterm exam, one final exam, two research briefs (Like 4-5 page essays), and two quizzes. You also have to submit reaction thoughts before every class which is ljust a short comment on the reading with a question or two",
          "TAKE THIS CLASS. Grading is super fair, if you put in minimal effort and study a little, it's very easy to get an A. Also, the material is super interesting, and i'm even considering a minor in linguistics now. Highly recommend this class to everyone",
          "This class had some cool topics so I thought it was fine",
          "Literally easiest A I've ever gotten--never did reading or homework and aced stuff",
          "Learned a lot about language and language use in general.",
          "The things I learned in this class were very applicable to the real world. The readings can be a lot but can be skimmed for sure. The tests are very fair and clear. The research briefs were interesting to write, and did not take that long to do. I really enjoyed this course! Prof Leddon is amazing too!",
          "This is a really good class to take, especially as a distro. Professor Leddon is really enthusiastic and the actual content of the lectures is interesting and the workload is definitely manageable.",
          "Professor Leddon is great! She puts a lot of information on the lecture slides so if you miss class it's not a big deal, but class is interesting and going definitely makes it easy to do well on the exams! Great distro.",
          "This class is an incredibly easy, low-time commitment distro\u02felective. Prof. Leddon is very helpful and engaging, and the class material is thought provoking and interesting. This is a great class.",
          "This class is boring but really easy. You don't have to do the reading or even really come to class, all she does is read off the powerpoints word for word and she posts the powerpoints online- so if you just study those you're fine. Take Ling 220 Language and Society with Annette D'Onofrio for a much more interesting and engaging course of similar material.",
          "Great class! Super interesting. Not a cake walk, but if you do the readings and go to class you'll do well. Professor Leddon is incredibly knowledgeable on the topic, passionate about what she teaches, and really wants students to enjoy and do well in the class. Highly recommend.",
          "I wanted to learn about the power of words in perpetuating inequality, and the course provided some insight into this, especially in areas that I had never even considered a possible source of contention",
          "Easy class but a lot of reading",
          "What I was most interested in was learning how much of an impact language has in society. People always think of prejudice in race and religion, but there is also prejudice in language.",
          "This class is rather basic, and the texts are informational, so it can be rather pedantic as opposed to having interesting discussion. VERY easy to do well, but the exams take themselves too seriously.",
          "Professor Leddon did a great job at teaching us the basics of linguistics and how the topic we are learning can be applied to our everyday lives. She is genuinely concerned with how each of her students are doing and makes an effort to remember our names. She is by far the most approachable professor I have met and I would love to take another course with her. Her exams are fair and not challenging at all if you attend her lectures and review her slides. Overall, this was a great class that definitely made an impact on my college career and life.",
          "Amazing and interesting class. The second half of the quarter is a little more technical...",
          "Great class! Professor Leddon is very engaging and uses relevant examples. The materials were helpful for my understanding. The exams and quizzes are pretty straightforward - if you come to lecture, pay attention, and review the slides you'll probably do pretty well",
          "A great distribution requirement -- it will teach you to become socially aware of how language affects different aspects of everyday life.",
          "Class materials are interesting, but it seems the evaluation methods are rather bad. The two exams and quizzes became \"memorization of slides\" instead of grasping the material and build up on them. Perhaps writing papers would be a better choice.",
          "This class will very possibly change the way you think about language and how it interacts with our day-to-day life. I highly recommend it."

          "Professor Gundlach is the epitome of effective and meaningful teaching. He always uses class time well and is engaged with the class and his students, and following the nature of this course, gives a voice to all his students in class and also through the topics that they wish to pursue. I really enjoyed this first-year seminar.",
          "This is such a good seminar! Professor really tries to help with your writing and provides valuable feedback. Is a lot of work in the beginning but mellows out a lot around midterms season. Class could get a little boring because professor really likes to talk but honestly wasn't that bad. Definitely recommend",
          "This class was a lot more work than I expected it be. There is a lot of reading to do, several essays to write, and a decent amount of busy work. Professor Gundlach was a very good professor and very wholesome, and the class content is super interesting, but it was a decent amount of work.",
          "Lots of readings in first half of course. Second half was more writing focused. Lots of essay revision, so this is not good for anyone who like to just write the paper the night before, but expect to get better at writing. Prof clearly cares about students, but talks like he's leading some kind of group meditation with lots of flowery language (idk how else to describe it) and each class period is very structured with little room for open discussion about the material.",
          "This is hands down the best class I've taken at Northwestern. This is the first teacher I've had that actually cared about his students as well as their progress in the course. He wanted to see every student improve. If you put forth your full effort in this class, there is no doubt you will succeed. At Northwestern, I\u027d had some bad experiences with previous writing teachers, however, this teacher truly made me feel confident about my writing abilities again. I\u027d highly recommend taking this course. I learned so much about the writing process, and I can actually say that my writing improved under Professor Gundlach's guidance. Furthermore, class discussion was always stimulating. I loved how much interest Professor Gundlach showed in topics that interested each and every one of the students. This was the most enjoyable class I've taken as well as the class in which I learned the most.",
          "Great class! Really opened my eyes to college-level writing. Would definitely recommend.",
          "This is my favorite course so far!!! Prof. Gundlach is an amazing instructor and his seminar has the perfect balance between the theoretical side of voice in the beginning of the class and the voice that you want to explore as a writer taking a linguistics class. You get so much freedom with your essays and can pursue whatever excites you the most! The class environment is very friendly as well. I strongly recommend this course, even if you are not super interested in linguistics. What you will get out of the class experience depends entirely on you and Prof. Gundlach is only going to help you figure out what you want to write about and what will work best for you as a writer. I just loved the class.",
          "This seminar was very interesting and wasn't too much work. Also, Prof. Gundlach is a great teacher and is really good at making students better writers. Regardless of your current writing ability, he will work with you in conferences and in class in order to give you the tools to make it that much better. Highly recommend putting this one towards the top of your list.",
          "Professor Gundlach was so kind and accommodating. He's always there to help students. Offers honest feedback and advice. Really cares for the students and their growth. Learned valuable lessons regarding the writing process.",
          "Professor Gundlach was amazing. He's so genuinely enthusiastic about the subject, and really pushed students to do their best work and writing. The course is more writing focused, with a nice amount of linguistics thrown in, but it's really interesting regardless. P. Gundlach is super understanding, and wants students to succeed. You have to put work into this class, but he makes it very enjoyable to do so. Overall, a very rewarding course.",
          "This course is a pretty basic first-year seminar. It mainly consists of readings, class discussions and essay writing. Professor Gundlach is incredibly nice and obviously very passionate about what he teaches. The classes might get a bit dull as the professor is very soft-spoken, but overall the class was pretty nice.",
          "This was one of my favorite courses at NU. Professor Gundlach is wonderful\u2014he really engaged the class in discussions and was available and accessible for questions and essay writing guidance outside of class. The class has four essay assignments, culminating in a self-driven research paper on a topic of your choice. Because of the research and writing experience in this course, I feel well-equipped and confident to go on and pursue research papers in othe classes. The subject matter is also fascinating and very far-reaching\u2014you\u2019d be surprised how much applies to the human voice (music, writing, creativity, artificial intelligence, doctor-patient relationships, and more!). I loved this class!",
          "This was a very interesting course where I got to take control on what I wanted to learn about and become a better writer. Professor Gundlach is one of the nicest teachers I've ever had and made the class both valuable and interesting"

There was a ton of information that was conveyed and sometimes the lectures seemed to ramble a little bit, but the breadth on information related to bilingualism was awesome and the weekly write-ups and discussions were super helpful in processing the information. Would definitely recommend to anyone with an interest in Cog Sci or Linguistics.",
          "I think that the course helped me read linguistics studies more effectively and be able to understand them rather than just regurgitate the information and learn about the neuro aspect of bilingualism",
          "Very easy course with clear expectations and routine; no exams, just weekly written assignments and a final group paper; but because we spent the entire quarter just discussing different research studies, I really don't feel like I learned much",
          "I really enjoyed this class! The first few weeks weren't very challenging but the course definitely gets harder as the quarter progresses. Very manageable workload and Prof Cibelli is very reasonable and understanding of students' needs.",
          "Half the lectures (one day out of two days per week) are discussions in small groups about the paper we read for homework. I am not really sure the meaning behind this but it seems if we used the time for another lecture we could have learned twice as much.",
          "Emily is great! The structure of the course was pretty good, with lectures on one day and discussion of the readings the next day. The studies and topics were interesting. Only assignments were weekly writing assignments and a final group paper.",
          "this class with emily cibelli is amazing (but she isn't teaching anymore). it's not a difficult class. don't need to pay too much attention to lectures because all the homework is reading scientific articles and summarizing them. no tests. final group project which is obnoxious, but very interesting if you DO pay attention.",
          "This course covered a wide range of subtopics related to bilingualism, which is a great introduction to anyone interested in this field.",
          "To be honest I didn't love the professor at first. The pace of this class is pretty slow - it's kind of frustrating when the professor spends fifty (50) minutes on the first day of class going over the syllabus. That being said, she was really, really clear about expectations, which I guess is nice. I liked the discussions we had every Thursday, but I also felt like we weren't covering as much material as I had hoped to because of that. There really wasn't that much work for this class. We had a group final, which I thought would be terrible but ended up being a fantastic experience. The professor grew on me over time. She's really great at facilitating discussion and answering questions, and her lectures are really engaging (most of them). Also her fashion sense is A+ on point all the time. A really interesting class!"

          "I recommend this class as a solid, easy natural science distro. Dr. Bradlow loves her field, and her passion is contagious. (\"I find this absolutely fascinating!\" - went on a tangent about how much she enjoys her job and thinking about phonetics.) The quizzes are pretty simple, and the projects are good review materials (I don't see how anyone can do badly on them unless they procrastinated horribly). If you attend lecture and pay attention, you'll be fine. The only drawback is that this class is a long early morning lecture and sometimes I end up falling asleep... even if Dr. Bradlow is a fantastic teacher, it's hard to sit there and stare at a screen for 1.5 hours.",
          "I was originally pretty interested in the class, thinking it would be an easy/interesting distro to take but it ended up being super super boring. You don't need to go to class at all, but definitely study a lot for the quizzes. Its only memorization.",
          "The class was super interesting and I learned a lot, which is exactly why I enrolled in the class. Unfortunately, the class was an hour and twenty minutes long and it was strictly lecture, which was not my favorite part about the course.",
          "This class is not too difficult. Some of the material is very interesting, but some is very boring. Everything, obviously, is relevant to linguistics, just some parts of linguistics are not exciting (like the topic of syllables). Ann Bradlow is alright.",
          "I didn't like the fact that I had to memorize words or concepts that I will probably never use again but all in all I enjoyed the course. Professor Bradlow is very good at conveying information in an easy to understand way and the TAs are always willing to help. It was definitely interesting finding out why we use certain vowels and consonants and how language varies through out the world.",
          "Bradlow was great. Knows her stuff. Tests are pretty easy if you pay attention in lecture. Don't have to study that much.",
          "I thought it was ne of the worst classes i've taken at NU. It didn't have much to do with the professor. more so i thought the topic was super boring",
          "Good, pretty interesting distro. Quiz 1 (midterm) and Quiz 2 (final) were straight forward, no surprises. There's plenty of materials and help from TAs. Easy to study in one day before the exam and do decently well. Would recommend to a friend.",
          "The textbooks for this class are very enjoyable to read, and the topic is interesting. It's easy to do well if you pay attention in class.",
          "Pretty good class. The content is on the whole interesting, but the coursework can be a little tedious and the pace is a bit slow.",
          "go to class and pay attention, study a couple of hours the day before the \"quiz\" aka midterm and you should pretty much get an A.",
          "This is a great class. Bradlow is very engaging with her students and is an amazing lecturer. Highly recommend.",
          "Good distro, relatively easy, relatively boring.",
          "Cool course that teaches you IPA and the basics of linguistics, prof puts up all lectures slides. HW projects are easy and make up half your grade so pretty easy A.",
          "Theatre majors: TAKE THIS CLASS. It will build off your understanding of the IPA, filling in the gaps that Voice for Performance simply didn't have time to address. It is also fascinating, and provides some insight into the foundations of dialects. This class is also great if you are interested in language or learning multiple languages, or if you're interested in artificial speech recognition and synthesis. Bottom line, this class covers a lot, is a VERY easy distro (I didn't pick up the text books once), and is actually quite interesting.",
          "Unnecessarily difficult. Don't take unless you have a large interest. It wasn't very much work but all of a sudden the tests were extremely difficult. Lectures were boring.",
          "This class is fairly easy. There are only 7 homework assignments and 2 midterms, which aren't too bad. Overall, this course was decent.",
          "Professor Barlow was able to keep me interested for most of the hour and a half in the class, and the material itself was actually pretty interesting as well. Definitely a solid distro.",
          "This class was SOMEWHAT INTERESTING DISTRO, certainly BETTER THAN ANY OTHER SCIENCE CLASS you could take.",
          "Easy class. If you study, you will do well",
          "Great class to take, whether or not you are a linguistics major. Professor Bradlow was always enthusiastic about the stuff we talked about in class, had great slides, and was highly knowledgeable about the subject. The class had assignments about every week or so and two quizzes. Definitely take this class and with Professor Bradlow!",
          "Pretty interesting class. Relatively low stress. \"Projects\" were essentially worksheets which actually help you learn quite a bit. Good course.",
          "Don't",
          "The class was boring. The lecturer just reads a powepoint for an hour and a half. Memorizing the phonetic alphabet is annoying. The assignments are usually ok but sometimes they get tedious and you wish the better taught so you knew what you were doing.",
          "Professor was great, really interesting course, great distro that's actually really interesting and not too challenging. Tests are not too bad if you study well. Reading is minimal and not totally necessary, though I found it interesting. Seven homework assignments and two exams.",
          "It's a ton of work, but it's worth it. She's the nicest professor and although the assignments are pretty lengthy, if you go to lecture they'll usually pretty much make sense. Exams were easy. Good distro.",
          "This class is fun and not terribly hard. I found the material pretty interesting and it doesn't require a crazy amount of work. Lectures were interesting but sometimes a little repetitive",
          "This class is fine for a science distro but there are definitely better ones. It was cool to learn about at first but then got unnecessarily complicated",
          "This is a fine natural sciences distrio.",
          "Overall this class is pretty easy. If you go to lecture and pay attention you should do just fine in the class.",
          "This course just left me feeling confused. I understood just enough to get by and and disliked how much of it was a gray area. But hey, that's language",
          "Pretty decent science distro; provided you learn IPA, do the projects and attend most lectures you will be good.",
          "This course seemed like it was probably a good one if you were into linguistics. I was not a fan of linguistics. I learned IPA though.",
          "I really liked this course. There is some memorization, but it is really cool to learn how the human sound system works. The first half of the quarter is really important set up for the rest of the quarter.",
          "I came in the class thinking linguistics would be helpful and interesting, but it really felt like another science class with a lot of memorization.",

          "Though it can be boring/heavily memorization based at times, the class was cool.",

          "Fairly easy distro. Hardest part is memorizing the IPA.",
          "This is a good class to take if you need a natural science distro. The lectures are kind of boring but the homework and midterms aren't super challenging if you go to class. The reading is not very helpful but there are some homework assignments from the book.",

          "This class was dry at times, but the work was very manageable. The tests were fair and the weekly quizzes were very helpful. Overall, I learned a lot.",
          "This course was a good distribution requirement because it was very straightforward and the instructors and TA were always there to help.",
          "Do not fall into the trap of thinking this class is an easy distro because it is not. The material is dull and feels useless and is impossible to learn. I wish I had just taken actual math.",
          "This course was interesting overall, but it gets kind of boring at times. Definitely a good course to take if you want to fill a distro requirement.",
          "Kind of a lot of work if you're just taking this course as a distribution requirement (weekly quizzes, homework assignments, readings, two exams) but it's still a very interesting class and I learned a lot.",
          "Not an easy distro but an interesting one. Lectures were super fast-paced but clear - if you go to class you don't really need to read. Test are easy compared to the difficulty of the material.",
          "This course is not too much work and you will learn a lot of interesting things about linguistics. Prepare to be very confused and lost often, because that's how I spent 90% of the course, but once you figure things out and study them they make more sense. Tests are easier than you think they will be. Scary because you're often confused but not too hard a class overall, and definitely interesting.",
          "Not an easy science distro - you'll get an A if you put in a lot of effort/time though!",
          "The professor is very knowledgeable and very passionate about the course.",
          "I really enjoyed this class. It was a great distro, easy, and super interesting.",
          "It was doable. I studied a lot the day before, did the assignments, and did well on the exams. There are only 2 exams, but they are not bad at all. Pretty easy class",
          "Nice course to start off on if you haven't taken a linguistics class before. It's very heavy in memorization so if that's not your thing you might avoid it but overall I thought the class was fair.",
          "Very interesting subject, lectures were pretty routine, a lot of memorization",
          "This course is awesome if you are interested in language, plus it's a pretty easy distro. There is a lot of material covered, especially in the first half of the quarter, but as long as you go to lecture, take notes on the powerpoints, complete the weekly quizzes/projects, and keep up with the readings, it's easy to get an A.",
          "This was a great distribution requirement that encouraged me to go further into the field of computational linguistics. Emily Cibelli is a great professor. The grading is fair but it is definitely not an easy A.",
          "You don't really need the textbooks for this class. The powerpoint slides are extremely helpful when reviewing for the exam. Stay on top of the material because it builds up and there's a lot of memorization. This is not really an easy distro unless you have a consistent study schedule because it isn't really material that you can cram in one night. There's a lot of concepts and memorization with the IPA chart and other charts that build off of each other.",
          "The assignments were reasonable and easy if u looked at the material. The class was not designed to trick students and the professors and TAs were very helpful in class and outside class.",
          "I really found the class to be interesting, but didn't expect the memorization aspect to it",
          "This was a very easy class, good distro, and you didn't really even have to go to the lectures.",
          "Ling 250 is not a bad class by any means. It is an introductory course so it goes over a lot of the basic phonetics and phonology concepts that you would need to know for further linguistics classes. The content isn't supremely challenging, but there is a good amount of memorization that you need to do. It seems daunting at first but just make sure to continually review the material so you're not stuck cramming. The lectures are pretty tedious because of the sheer amount of content covered in each class so be prepared for that. Professor Cibelli is enthusiastic and eases some of those issues though. The projects and quizzes are EXTREMELY important so do not overlook them, they end up making up the majority of your grade and should be aced if you put the time in. Overall, not a bad class at all very much what you would expect from an introductory course, would recommend.",
          "Good natural science distro. You'll do fine without reading the material (don't spend too much money on the books... they're not worth it). I mark \"3 or fewer hours\" because I stopped doing the readings (and was fine by it). Sometimes the book will include material that you will not need to know. But, the readings are usually pretty short, so it's very feasible. You have projects every 1-2 weeks, which are basically just worksheets with problems related to the material. They are very easy at the beginning but get a bit tougher at the end. They don't take that long to do. There are also quizzes on canvas you have to do (about 12-15 questions each) that also help you rehearse the material. You can take them over as many times as you want until you get the grade you want. Honestly, I don't know why anyone wouldn't do the projects and quizzes, since they're quick and easy grade boosters and help you rehearse the material throughout the course (I actually kind of liked having them because I honestly wouldn't have really studied the material outside of class until exam time). Just don't forget to do them and you're good. The lectures might get kind of boring, but you can just review the slides afterwards. It's not hard to catch up if you miss a class or two. You do some very simple partner discussions at the end of the lectures if theres time. There are two exams... one after the phonetics unit... and one after the phonology unit. For the final, we have project #6 due. The professor's voice is kind of monotonous, but she does a good job of making the material clear for us. She is also very approachable. You can submit questions anonymously about class material and she will go over it in class the next lecture.",
          "I thought this class would be super easy, but you do have to put a bit of work into it. There is a LOT of memorizing. You don't have to go to lecture, emily posts everything online",
          "Great class! Took it as a distro, but the subject is actually really interesting, and Professor Cibelli is awesome. She was always willing to review topics students were having trouble with. Six worksheets, two in class exams, and weekly Canvas quizzes didn't take up too much time and were a great way to reinforce the material. Would recommend!",
          "Do not need the textbooks, but GO TO CLASS. This is extremely helpful in explaining otherwise abstract powerpoints.",
          "TAKE THIS FOR A GOOD CLASS - if you do your work, it is awesome!!!",
          "This is the easiest one of the linguistics 2X0 sequence. A lot of memorization, but most of the topics covered are really straightforward.",
          "Overall a good class - solid natural science distro. Not the easiest A but very manageable if you pay attention, and the topic is interesting.",
          "Do not buy the books for this class, they are not necessary. 6 Take home projects worth 8% each. 8 quizzes online worth 4% total which should be a guaranteed 100% if you care because you have unlimited attempts. 2 exams are the rest of the grade. More work than I wanted for a distro but not too bad. Go to office hours for help with projects, you will not regret it.",
          "Cibelli is a clear and engaging lecturer, and I personally found the topic very interesting and applicable to other language-related courses (e.g. poetry, foreign languages, etc.). Based on suggestions from previous CTECS, I got a slight head start and began studying the IPA two weeks before the beginning of the course, and ended up way ahead of everyone else. It doesn't take that much effort, but makes a huge difference. Nevertheless, this is a very straightforward course; you won't have any trouble if you learn the IPA reasonably well within the given time frame.",
          "This class was pretty interesting. I definitely enjoyed the first half better. Make sure you are studying throughout, rather than right before the exams, because it's a lot of material that can be tricky to understand. Professor Cibelli is super nice and a good lecturer. However, she covers SO much material throughout lecture that it can be overwhelming...another reason why studying throughout will be helpful. If you study and do all the assignments, the 2 exams are not that difficult.",
          "Prof Cibeli is really nice, course can be a little tricky for internationals",
          "The lecture's contained a lot of information and were really good study tools for me. The lecture style was very clear and she made sure to answer any questions we had and even addressed them in the slides. The tests weren't too hard. If you study like a normal person, you'll do great in this class. The information was pretty fun to learn. For a distro I would 100% recommend. Really not a hard class. Some of her lectures seemed a little drawn out but not too bad.",
          "This course wasn't very interesting, which was disappointing. DON'T BUY THE TEXTBOOKS. Literally one day of reading was assigned - total waste of money. The teaching was good, but lectures were often boring and each class covered an overwhelming amount of material, just slide after slide of facts and categorizations.",
          "the course was very difficult at times as there is a lot to memorize and then learn how to apply and manipulate which was sometimes a lot to handle. after i overcame that part of the course, the theoretical aspects were much easier to follow.",
          "You do not need the books for this course. The slides are great and you can learn a lot by reading them and spending time studying.",
          "Very easy class, and helpful knowledge for everyday life. I didn't think I\u027d be interested in this class, but I really enjoyed learning about everything I was already subconsciously doing while speaking.",
          "EC is a great lecturer and it's pretty easy to follow along. The content is rather dense so I recommend going over the slides after the lecture. you don't really need to do the readings to be honest. The projects and midterms were decent but nothing too difficult. And guys I'm in SESP.",
          "Don't take this as a distribution. Definitely not an easy A or even B+.",
          "A lot of material, still glad I took it as a distro requirement.",
          "Easy course. Take it",
          "This class was honestly harder than advertised. Two exams, second harder than the first, definitely have to study a fair amount for both. Professor Cibelli seems very nice and available to help, but definitely a bit of a challenge. Also a pretty boring class, although she does her best to make it seem interesting, as she herself is definitely very interested in the subject.",
          "Professor is very organized and slide materials are useful. Go to class if possible. Weekly hw (projects) are not very hard but overall the material, for someone completely unfamiliar with linguistics, is quite difficult. Worth learning though.",
          "Not too difficult if you attend all classes, remember to take the weekly online quizzes, and get your experimental credits taken care of. The final is cumulative but I found it easier than the midterm. I bought both of the textbooks for the class, but didn't read them at all. Maybe if I had I would have gotten an A instead of an A-.",
          "The course felt a bit dull at times, but overall it was an okay class and I learned quite a bit.",
          "Emily is a great instructor. I constantly have trouble paying attention in other lectures, but I never had trouble paying attention in this class. Emily is very engaging, and helpful. She knows a lot about the subject and is more than willing to assist. She is also very helpful in office hours. Overall, the class took an amount of work, but a lot less than other courses, and it is very interesting."

I didn't know anything about linguistics before taking the class, but it was very easy to grasp the content from the lectures and the powerpoint slides, which are posted on Canvas and are super helpful when studying for quizzes and midterms. Half the battle is learning the IPA, and that wasn't as bad as I was expecting; once I figured it out, it stuck with me so I didn't even need to study that part of the class for the second midterm. I would highly recommend this class for anyone, especially if you're looking for an easy science distro.",
          "If you need a natural sciences distro, this is a great course to take. It isn't too much work and if you study the midterm and final are very doable.",
          "This class had a lot of memorization (i.e. learning IPA symbols and the classification of sounds), but everything was explained clearly in the lectures. The reading and workload was manageable, but I didn't think the readings added much to the class. The subject matter was overall interesting.",
          "I would've never learned anything about IPA had I not taken this class. Took it for a distro and was a pretty unique class to take in that regard. However, I would probably take an easy distro if I could go back and change this class. I find the grading in this class to be fairly skewed (HW is 30% of your grade, and there are only 6 HW assignments. Also, six 5-question quizzes make up 12% of your grade.) towards largely unimportant tasks that you can easily lose points on. Exams aren't that hard unless you study. This class has interesting subject material that you probably wouldn't learn about otherwise, but you should definitely take an easier distro if you want to save yourself effort.",
          "I found the class interesting and not difficult to understand, but I can see how it would be more on the boring side if this isn't what you're interested in.",
          "The course provided a very good introduction into Linguistics in an introductory as well as cross-disciplinary way.",
          "Focused too much on things that could've been learned outside of class",
          "This was a pretty chill class, and professor Cole is relatively relaxed. You can totally get away with not doing the readings, but I probably would have done a lot better if I\u027d done them. All in all, pretty good science distro, but you're better off just taking rocks for jocks",
          "Fairly easy! Only homework are hard, but doesn't take that long if you go to class! No need to do the readings! EXAMS EASY",
          "This class is a good distro. It is fairly straightforward material and not too difficult. The last few weeks of the course get a little more abstract than the first part of the course, but it is not too bad. The 2 midterms exams cover the material well. If you pay attention and take notes in class, you'll do fine. The second midterm is cumulative, so keep that in mind. Overall, I good class to take. The professor goes through some of the slides really quickly though, so make sure to be ready.",
          "I took this class for a distribution requirement, and it was great!",
          "It was a good sister. I learned more than I thought I would and it wasn't extremely difficult.",
          "This class is okay. Professor Cole is clearly very passionate about the topic, but it's difficult when almost everyone in the class isn't a linguistics major. All assignments are fair and it's easy to get low A/high B if you pay attention in class. Don't have to do any of the readings!",
          "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! Material is easy to learn and the exams are straightforward. Teacher is very willing to help and is passionate about the material she is teaching.",
          "I personally did not like the class. It was boring and it was a struggle coming to class. If you don't get the first half, you literally SCREWED for the second half of the course. The professor, however, had lots of energy so that was the highlight of the class.",
          "This course required a lot of memorization, especially when it came time to learn the IPA. However, I learned a lot too. This isn't a hard class concept wise.",
          "This course was interesting and engaging. There was slightly more homework than expected, but it helped me prepare for the quizzes and exams.",
          "Some of the text readings were a bit hard to understand, but the lectures were very clear and informative and the homework assignments never felt like busy work and were actually sort of fun! The students were also able to contribute examples and answers during lectures, which made class time more engaging."

Homeworks once a week are not too much to deal with and the weekly quizzes are also not too bad if you study a bit. Lecturer was good, just be warned it is an easy class to fall asleep in if you have a short attention span.",
          "Really hard class!! Not very interesting and very hard to do well. Don't take it unless you have some interest in the subject otherwise it's super boring",
          "First half of the course was pretty boring; it got more interesting in the second half. If you show up and pay attention, you will probably get an A.",
          "There is a decent amount of memorization needed for this course. I was interested in languages and this course was definitely interesting. However, it was very english centric and would mention other languages from time to time. Professor Bradlow is very passionate about the subject but the homeworks are annoying. The Ta's graded harshly and the class is an easy A\u02fa- if you put in more than 5 hours before the test to memorize the material.",
          "This course was pretty easy and interesting but the way that the homework and tests were graded were pretty nitpicky so you should probably go to office hours and or email the professors and TAs.",
          "Good course for basics of phonetics and phonology, would recommend to anyone interested in linguistics",
          "The workload outside of class isnt bad, but you do need to go to lecture to really understand the concepts and be ready for the exams.",
          "I was really interested in Linguistics before taking this course and found it to be really stimulating.",
          "I knew nothing about linguistics coming into this course. I felt like it gave me a good overview of the subject and was an enjoyable topic to learn about.",
          "I really enjoyed this class. Like any linguistics class, it challenges you to think about language in a way you might not have before. The stuff you learn seems overwhelming at first, but they break it down pretty easily and the assignments aren't too difficult. There are group quizzes though, which is annoying, but okay. It does not seem as random\u02farbitrary as semantics or syntax can be, which might be a bonus for someone looking for an interesting distro requirement that won't give them a headache",
          "Super interesting course! Prof Bradlow does the best job I've seen at NU of filling a medium/large lecture class with hands-on learning. Weekly quizzes with a team element that can boost your grade, assignments, and in-class practica (that aren't stressful because they don't go toward your grade) make learning along the way easy so that when the exams come along you're already pretty prepared! Engaging material and great teaching.",
          "Don\u2019t worry about getting the textbook- Bradlow\u2019s lecture slides provide a wealth of information and include everything that will be on exams. Super interesting class, but kinda boring towards the end.",
          "The professor was very good and stimulated our interest in the subject, and I enjoyed the fact that this was a linguistics class but had some graphs/mathy stuff in there too",
          "Linguistics is a subject I knew nothing about coming in. This class provided me with the resources to learn what felt like a whole new language, and I loved it! Bradlow really loves to teach this material so lectures are mostly engaging and interesting. The first half of the course comes really easily, but the second half is more abstract and requires some more thought.",
          "This was a really fun and easy class. The interactive homeworks were pretty cool and the lectures were almost always pretty interesting",
          "Bradlow is a master of the course. Complete control over every class, and a truly wonderful pace to the course.",
          "It was a fair course. We had quizzes and homework almost every week but they were a nice way to remember the material and were not a lot of work.",
          "do NOT take this as an easy distro. it's not easy.",

          "Good natural science distro if you don't want to do more physicsy or chemistry type courses, especially if you are interested in linguistics",
          "The material was pretty interesting and I was looking forward to taking this class. However, it was hard to enjoy the course because most of the people in the class were only there as a distribution requirement, so as soon as they realized it would take even a little bit of work to get an A in the class, they complained a lot, which really made the course a lot more depressing. But if you go into it with a good mindset, its not a super hard course and it is actually really interesting! Professor Bradlow is also super wonderful and engaging!",
          "Great class but at times very slow moving.",
          "Boring course. First midterm is easy and just memorization. Second is a bit more challenging and very long. Don't need to go to class to do well -- homeworks are what can affect your grade.",
          "This is a great class for a MST distro! Not super math or science heavy if you're not into that. It was fun, the homework was short worksheets, and quizzes weren't difficult.",
          "This course was kind of difficult for a distro, but you definitely learn a lot. There is not a lot of homework but you need to study the slides between classes or it's hard to keep up.",
          "I thought the pace of the class was very fast. I never really understood what was going on and had to teach myself the material. I also thought it was unfair how much weight the homework assignments held considering these are supposed to be practice and were often very long and challenging. Even if you do extremely well on the midterm and exam, you still won't end up with a good grade because of the homework.",
          "Lot of memorization, but not too difficult. This class is definitely worth it if you are at all interested in linguistics-- a great distro. I learned a lot of new things that will stay with me forever and was constantly fascinated by the information being presented in class.",
          "This class is super fun and easy. I personally love linguistics, though, so I'm biased.",
          "The first half of the quarter is basically teaching you IPA, and the second half is random other topics.",
          "It's a GREAT way to fulfill a natural science distro without competing with premeds.",
          "You don't need to do any of the reading (or even buy the textbooks probably), since all the tested material is only from the lectures (sometimes contradicting other sources).",
          "PLEASE TAKE THIS DISTRIBUTION CREDIT. This class is an incredibly east A. The averages on the midterm and final are over 90. The majority of the grade is determined by homework assignments. The workload in incredibly minor.",
          "Interesting distro course with great instruction. Easy A as long as you do the homework.",
          "Tha course was difficult. It required you to really pay attention to class and study every lecture for the quizzes and HW assignments you had each week. Additionally, the grading was picky.",
          "I was not a fan of this class. I actually hated it. Only towards the end did I start to realize that it could\u2019ve been interesting, but the format of the class and the teaching just made me dislike it. Class was always boring and it really is a lot of information to learn in a quarter. But it\u2019s not all that hard if you study for the midterms and do well on the homework\u2019s (which are kind of hard)",
          "This course actually surprised how much material is covered and how much of it was new to me. Lectures can be dry sometimes, but I never regretted going to class cause it always helped with the quizzes.",
          "This course was interesting and I learned a lot. It was a bit too dry though, and it needed a lot of memorization.",
          "This course was fantastic. Professor Bradlow is a great teacher, and you can really tell how much she cares about the subject. A fantastic distro. I learned alot, and the tests are pretty straightforward. Not a ton of work outside of class time, and a very interesting subject. (You don't have to do any of the readings, just pay attention in lecture.)",
          "Great class! not too difficult, pretty straightforward. exams are fair if you study beforehand. I recommend--- go for it, take this class.",
          "Pretty interesting class. Homeworks were kind of annoying and unclear sometimes, but the group quizzes were nice. I had a pretty hard time staying focused in lecture even though I thought the material was pretty interesting. Exams were fairly easy even though the homeworks were always a wildcard. Overall I\u027d recommend this class as a science distro, it's pretty cool.",
          "Great, great class. I took it purely for fun, because I always found linguistics and IPA etc interesting. Loved the material and found myself thinking about it all the time, mumbling random sounds to myself (which my roommate rather enjoyed). Professor Bradlow is great, and and she did a fantastic job making the course so engaging.",
          "There is so much information in this course and the professor flew through the notes making it hard to learn in class.",
          "Really easy, really interesting course! Course work consists of weekly homeworks and quizzes, as well as two exams. I\u027d always been interested in linguistics, but taking this course really pushed me to want to take more linguistics classes in the future!",
          "The tests and homework are very doable, hardest part of the course is the weekly quizzes which you should spend some time to study for",
          "Professor Bradlow CARES about this course, her content, and her students' ability to learn what she is so excited to share. She maintains a professional disposition, but occasionally slips into a more casual approach, even going so far as hidden memes within her slides. Take this course as a distro, or as anything else.",
          "I loved 250-0! The subject was completely new to me, but the pace was good and the readings supplemented the lectures well so I didn't feel overwhelmed. 2 tests, one for each half of the course but the second one covers most of the quarter material. Learning the IPA is really interesting & generally makes language more interesting overall. Take the course, especially if you need the distro!",
          "The lecture is not really important, as long as you read each slide carefully after class.",
          "This course is fairly easy. All the lectures are posted on canvas and the tests aren't too hard at all. The homeworks are graded extremely harshly and the directions are often very vague. This class should be an easy A if you manage to do well on the homeworks",
          "The lectures were not super interesting but it's clear Professor Bradlow is passionate. The little quizzes were frustrating because if you got more than one wrong, you failed but being able to bring up your score with a team score was helpful.",
          "The course is basically like learning a new language. The powerpoints made it difficult to distinguish important information and I found it very hard to use PRAAT.",

While I was eventually able to perform well on the midterm and final, I often felt that the lectures didn't prepare me enough for the quizzes and assignments; I often found it more helpful to google concepts than to refer to my notes. While I was eventually able to get everything down in time to study for the tests, I didn't perform well on the assignments and quizzes, and my grade suffered because of that.",
          "I always try to keep an open mind regarding courses outside of my major, but I can honestly say this is one of the worst courses I've taken in the 3 years I've been in college. And not even necessarily in terms of the material, but in terms of the instruction. Language in general is so abstract and can get complicated, but it's only further convoluted when the concepts are not taught effectively. We moved through (complicated!) material in lectures far too quickly, and the sequence of topics did not feel organized whatsoever. I spent way too much time just teaching myself the material in this course outside of class because when we wouldn't finish slides, Prof Cole would just tell us to read it at home. On top of that, the homework never took me less than 2 hours to complete \u2014 and even when I did spend a lot of time on it, I sometimes didn't achieve any more clarity in the topic. You end up with a group of people to work with for this course, and all of us agreed that this class was really not enjoyable, and that the material, while interesting, was difficult to understand a lot of the time because of the instruction. Overall, it just felt like they crammed way too much material in each week, and it definitely showed. During the final exam, only about half of the material you see in the lecture slides actually make it onto the exam, so you end up studying for far longer than is necessary \u2014 time that could have been more effectively spent working on assignments for other courses.",

The course is likely great for students who are actually majoring in Linguistics and have had some experience in it, but for students who are just taking it as an \"introductory\" science distro, this did not feel introductory at all. The thing is, I liked the material and I did find it interesting, but I experienced so much frustration because it was taught so poorly. So all in all, if you're thinking of taking this course as a science distro that you've had no experience in and that you think you\u027d enjoy, I highly, HIGHLY advise against doing so.",

It is not an easy A but it is definitely possible to get A\u02fa- with 1-4hrs/week of work. There's weekly homework assignments and quizzes. Low-key the quiz grades are important because it can push your grade from a B+ to an A-. There's only 2 exams which aren't bad. The TAs and Professor Cole are accommodating with grade concerns and confusing information. Also it's fine if you miss a few lectures.",

It's a lot of homework, quizzes, and projects to fill a requirement. The material can be really hard and confusing and the homework is not easy. It can be interesting and better than straight math, but keep in mind it's a lot of work.",

          "I took this class for a distro and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVED IT. The trick is to put in the effort for the first two weeks by memorizing the IPA chart. After that, it's crazy easy and crazy interesting. I learned how to make a ton of sounds that don't occur in English but occur in other languages, like clicks and different kinds of ingressives and fricatives and plosives and all that. Really, really, really interesting class. The two exams were easy and the two projects took maybe an hour each. Highly recommend for an area 1 distro",

It was fairly interesting, sometimes tedious, depending on the topic. Weekly quizzes aren't too bad-- just make sure you memorize the lecture slides! All you need to do in this class in order to be successful is study the lecture slides. !!!Study the lecture slides!!! You just gotta memorize them. The homework isn't too bad either and it helps to solidify whatever you learned in class that week.",

Learning the IPA symbols and interpreting the spectrographs and wavelengths were quite tricky at first but as long as you pay attention during lecture you should be okay.",
          "This class does not cover the most interesting content, but Professor Cole does a great job communicating concepts and making things more interesting. The workload is very reasonable, and the two exams are very easy. The quizzes are most important for your grade, so be prepared for those. If you're thinking of this class for the distro, it's fairly easy and not too boring (we all use language, so it's relatable content). Professor Cole is also super helpful during office hours. Overall, a very reasonable intro course!",

          "This course is an easy distro if you attend and pay some attention during lectures. The exams are simple and contain the exact material that would be expected.",
          "I really enjoyed the course and learned a lot fo interesting new things. I'm very proud to know the IPA chart and hung it above my bed!",
          "Recommend! Linguistics is fascinating and Professor Cole is super good at teaching this course. Lectures are dry and you don't really have to go to do well, but you should because the homeworks are super hard and confusing. Also, the weekly quizzes aren't as easy as you expect, so study in advance. Both exams were super doable, but you have to study a lot and it's not an Easy A. But if you study a lot and do well on the homework and other assignments, you will be very prepared!",
          "This course is not an easy distro that you can spend less than 3 hours a week. The homework is super time-consuming. Overall, a hard A-",
          "Jennifer Cole is like an ethereal goddess: I'm both scared of her and want to be her. The course material is really interesting and she's really excited to be teaching it, which is great. I wish we\u027d done more. Sometimes the projects (which aren't hard) felt like busy work, and it felt unnecessary having a project due finals week in addition to the exam (which is the last day of class.)",
          "This was a very interesting class for a distro requirement! The most important advice I can give is to commit the basic material to memory EARLY ON. Otherwise, you will struggle to understand later concepts, as the information builds on itself throughout the quarter. I did not find reading the textbook to be useful, but office hours with Professor Cole were always very helpful. The homework was the most aggravating part of the course because not much instruction was given and grading was a bit picky. Overall, good class!",
          "I thought this course was interesting, albeit a bit dry at times. I took it as a core course for the cognitive science major and, while I wish I had taken a course about the meaning of words instead, I thought this course was actually taught really well. The material isn't that difficult, but you actually have to spend time with it if you want to do well in the course, which isn't hard to do.",
          "Amazing introduction to the study of sound patterns :)",
          "It was a fun distro, but I don\u2019t think I will use the knowledge for anything useful in the future",
          "Interesting content. A lot of work but worth it",
          "this class was a great introductory class to linguistics. Professor Cole made it so that the information was easy to understand and she was very willing to spend time outside of class to help her students. Her midterms and homeworks were graded very fairly and the group components of the class added much educational value. Alas, I got a B-. YOLO.",
          "If you're looking for an easier distro, do NOT take this class!!! There is a ridiculous amount of information and you are expected to know just about all of it. Homework is graded harshly and is difficult. The class moves at a rapid pace.",
          "I enjoyed how the course content is relatively easy to understand, which then led to me spending less time trying to memorize material.",
          "The material itself was not too bad as long as you kept up with the work. The readings were not necessary-only relevant for clarification. As long as you review the powerpoints you should be fine",
          "This was a moderately challenging course. A huge amount of your grade is based on graded homework assignments. There are 2 projects, a midterm, and a final. The tests are fairly easy. Lectures are fairly boring, but most of the information overlaps with the readings. There is a quiz once per week, so you really only have to go to those classes.",
          "I thought this course was fine overall, but not anything particularly exciting or engaging for me. I thought the instruction was sometimes dull and the alignment of the course textbook with the in class material was sometimes incongruous. I enjoyed doing more practical applications of this material, like in our projects and group work.",
          "IPA seems daunting but it's really not that bad (especially since you only really need to commit the English IPA stuff to memory), overall course seemed really fair and I learned a surprising amount.",
          "Good class, lots of memorization, go to class and work hard on the homeworks and you'll be fine",
          "This class really helped me to apply and develop my critical thinking skills. IT WAS FUN!",
          "At the beginning it seems like it is complicated and hard but if you put enough work and time it is actually an easy class. However, there are quizzes every week so be ready for them.",
          "Interesting course and not difficult at all. The homework and studying for the quizzes can be annoying but aside from that is good and easy."

Prof. Ward is an incredible professor; he often gets going on tangents, but those tangents are still somewhat relevant to the discussion and still interesting. Class only has a midterm as well as a final (or a research paper instead), and readings are interesting and not too time-consuming.",
          "This class is very abstract and conceptual, so be prepared to speak your ideas and share questions\u02fcomments. Prof Ward really likes to open discussion to the class, so there are days when the points in the lecture are not the main takeaway. For this reason it's really important to show up to class and be engaged in discussion",
          "Professor Ward is wonderful. Highly recommend him as a professor. He is very passionate in teaching this course. He is very willing to help you if you feel like you're struggling. The material of the class can be a bit difficult if you know nothing of pragmatics, but Ward does a good job of simplifying difficult concepts. There is one take-home open-book midterm exam and then the option of a paper or another take-home exam for the final. That is the only coursework. I did none of the reading for the course and only used the book when I needed help on the exams. If you are a linguistics major or minor, this is a solid elective class.",

Nevertheless, Professor Ward really stimulated my interest in pragmatics by showing us the \"artistic\" side of language usage, and this class has easily been the most enjoyable class for me this quarter. I wish we had more time to cover all the course materials in no hurry, but that is simply unrealistic given the quarter system and the massive amount of exciting topics in pragmatics."

The class is easy to follow, and the workload is very reasonable (readings and two take-home exams). The discussions we had in class sometimes brought us off topic a little but were always very interesting and usually brought something new and relevant to the table. I really enjoyed taking this class. Great choice for major and even non-majors interested in the topic.",
          "Gregory is truly wonderful in class. So incredible knowledgeable and conversational",
          "This a GREAT class. By far one of the most interesting linguistics classes out there in terms of the material. Prof Ward is very effective and engaging lecturer. He is very passionate about the subject, so listening to the lectures was actually quite fun. The format of the class was really nice, no tedious problem sets! Take home exams were fair and manageable. Take this class :-)",
          "Class is mostly lecture based with a lot of questions. It's based off the readings. Make sure you do the readings because the midterm and final are both take home and require you to fully understand the readings.",
          "This is my favorite section of Linguistics! This class only has 2 midterms and participation, which is good for not having a lot of homework but a little nervewracking since the assignments count for so much and you don't get any feedback on participation. Ward is an entertaining professor who encourages students to ask questions and to meet with him. Sometimes, though, he can be the stereotypical tenured professor who uses his job to push his political views even when they have nothing to do with the topic.",
          "This is one of my favorite linguistics courses so far. Ward is very passionate about the material and makes every lecture interesting. The material is easily applicable to your everyday conversations, so it's not at all hard to understand. Midterm, Final, class participation."

          "This course is a great distribution requirement - as long as you get 100% on the quizzes and don't miss a study day, you don't really have to attend class. The questions on the tests are given beforehand on a study guide, so as long as you know the content on there, you'll be absolutely fine.",
          "This class was a good distro. It did not require a lot of work and it isn\u2019t too hard to get an A. I personally did not find the material to be very interesting because it is all about the history, culture, and language of the Balkans. But considering the amount of work the class requires, it was a good class to take for a distro.",
          "This course taught me a lot about a subject I was not at all familiar in, but it could get very dry at times.",
          "Class was definitely not my type as I am not the greatest reader. There was a lot of reading, but on the most part they're only necessary for the 8 online quizzes throughout the quarter. You are allowed to drop 3 of those quizzes. The midterm and final you are given a study guide. That makes it easier to prepare for the tests, but you still have to prepare. Class is rather boring but there are group work days where attendance is checked for points.",

          "Okay do NOT take this class if you are wanting a good history distro. This is WAY more of a linguistics class than anything else. Also people might say its an easy A but the material is so boring and lectures are so disorganized that its really hard to have any interest in the subject to begin with, and much harder to study for. I\u027d say its an easy B+. Also Professor Elliott is was better to talk to in person... its very hard to follow her in class and her slides are equally as bad. If you need help throughout the quarter, definitely just go straight to her in office hours and avoid referring to the slides or TAs who were sooo unhelpful - and there were 3 of them!!",

Only a few online quizzes based on the reading (you get to drop like 3\u02f8), a biography which everyone gets 100 on, and the midterm and final which she gives you the questions too in advance. Take this class if you want a very easy class that is actually really interesting as well.",
          "This is a fantastic course! The subject matter is very interesting over a region not many people know much about. Professor Elliott, however, is the best part.",

          "This class was not very difficult. The subject is pretty interesting and the readings are pretty good but the lectures were a little dry and somewhat boring.",
          "I loved the Prof and I learned so much about this region. Quizzes drove me insane sometimes and the in class group work was frustrating because most of the students have incentive to free-ride off of other students. Grading was fair and work was minimal. Good distro.",

          "easy distro!! elliot is really good at making this course interesting and she can be really accommodating for students, there is a light workload and pseudo take home exams",
          "Easy distro, boring information. The readings are so long, but you don't necessarily have to do them.",
          "Manageable distro! Some people skip class, but I found the lectures interesting. It's a huge class so you can work on your ling HW during lecture. I would definitely recommend this distro because it's not too challenging but engaging enough to be a solid class.",
          "Fascinating. Not too much work, heavy weighting on exams. Go to class or do readings",
          "Easy A\u02fa- for an ethics distro, but not a very good one. Go to class right after the exam - attendance is taken, which really felt like an unfair dig at students who were busy during midterms week. The class tries to cover too many topics in too short of a time and becomes very confusing, but luckily the midterm\u02ffinal exam review sheets tell you what you need to know.",
          "Easiest class I have taken in academia. Including elementary school.",
          "Pretty Easy distro. I feel like I learned a bit about the Balkans and the people who live there. Lectures could be a little dry, but ultimately the class is pretty fair.",
          "good ethics distro",
          "It was fairly easy and interesting would rte 9\u2f10",
          "Yeah so if you're looking for a class to completely just chill in, this is it. Don't have to go to lectures, she gives study guides before every midterm and final so you literally just have to memorize those and you'll be fine for the tests. The content is interesting and really easy A (assuming you look at the study guides).",
          "I was very disappointed with this course. I thought I was going to learn much more about the Balkans themselves but I honestly feel like I left knowing nothing about the actual region and just the linguistic history. The course material was just not engaging whatsoever but class is required because of the group work so I\u027d really recommend not skipping. You don't really need to do the reading except for the online quizzes which are pretty straightforward, the tests are mostly on the lectures and then you can refer back to specific readings. There is also a linguistic\u02fethnic biography which almost everyone gets an 100 on, and group work attendance goes into your grade. The one great thing about this class was that the midterm and final are in class but you get the questions beforehand so you know what to expect. However, I felt like the midterm was graded very subjectively and I got points off for things that I didn't know I was expected to write down even though I answered the question as they asked for it. I was told to come to the review session for the final and ask to go over the short answers so that I would know exactly what to write. But because of the gun scare that day, the review session was cancelled, which is totally understandable- however, TAs should have been available to answer questions via email or the review session should have been postponed. Yet the TAs did not answer emails for the rest of the day or the next day (when the early optional final was) which was very unprofessional and not fair. That being said, Professor Elliott is super nice and seems like she cares about her students. I just wish this class was more organized and engaging. Honestly, everyone says this class is easy but since it was so disorganized and dry I would honestly just recommend taking a different class that is more interesting even if it is harder, you'll probably get more out of it and have an easier time studying if you find the topic engaging.",
          "Course is very well organized and the instructor helps the students to be prepared for exams by providing study guides.",
          "Very manageable workload",
          "TAKE THE EXAMS SERIOUSLY. The class is pretty laid back and the readings aren't hard to process but definitely study for the exams and make sure you have everything ready for the exams.",
          "nice distro. memorize and regurgitate and you'll be fine",
          "super easy distro. Can get really boring so just come prepared with stuff to do during lecture.",
          "Good for a distro. Would not recommend for fun.",
          "Overall, Professor is very knowledgable and taking this course is a good option for those who are seeking to clear a distribution requirement or otherwise check out the field of linguistics",
          "I know other CTECs say this class is an easy A, but it only can be easy if you're either genuinely interested in the Balkans or if you're good at memorization. It helps that she gives you topics and essay prompts that will be on the midterm and final beforehand, because otherwise it would definitely be too much course content to have to know. It takes a decent amount of time to prepare for both exams but its definitely worth it. An A is attainable if you put in the work to cram for both. Readings along the way are necessary due to canvas quizzes, which is helpful when trying to think of textual evidence for your essay responses on tests.",
          "I wanted a class that was manageable and interesting. I wanted a class that wasn't overwhelming with a professor who was kind. This class met all of those criteria and helped me gain a newfound appreciation for the Balkans as well.",
          "Great course, great distro! Fairly easy and very interesting! You will walk away from this class a better person because you will have a better understanding of how language informs our perceptions of others. You will have a better understanding of how language influences your sense of self and your sense of belonging to an ethnicity or nation.",
          "The readings for the course were not very dense; they were fairly easy to understand. The professor sums up the main points in the lecture slides pretty well. The linguistic concepts are easy, anyway. If you're someone who is unfamiliar with the Balkans like me, the tricky part might be learning the history and geography of the region, but the Professor Elliot and the TAs do a good job of breaking it down for you.",
          "There are weekly reading quizzes on Canvas but they are super easy and short, and the professor drops your three lowest scores. There are also random group assignments during lecture in which they take attendance, but don't let that deter you from taking this class. Boo hoo, go to lecture.",
          "I would definitely take this class if you're looking for a good Ethics and Values distro. Professor Elliot is approachable, clear in her lectures, and simply a joy to learn from.",
          "Super great distro. Highly recommend",
          "This course is deceptively difficult.",
          "This is a solid distro. The midterm and final are super straightforward. Prof Elliott is an engaging prof who sometimes talks about things not related to the Balkans, but who really makes it easy to succeed if you put in the time and work",
          "This class is pure memorization. Pretty easily graded and a great way to get an Ethics or History Distro out of the way. The material is super boring and I feel like there was no use in learning the material we did. That being said, with only 2 nights required of studying for the midterm and final this class is worth taking for the A.",
          "Professor Elliott is a kind person, but is a boring lecturer. I was originally excited for this class, but after each progressive lecture it became a struggle to go to class even (most people did not towards the end). It's an easy class though, just be prepared for some work/memorization/reading of course",
          "do not take this as a distro, there are much more interesting ones that don't require you to memorize 20 pages of facts for the exams",
          "Interestingish material but lectures are very boring",
          "If you are interested in any aspect of the course title, then you would like this class. If you are looking to fulfill a distro, this class will be pretty boring for you.",
          "This course is exactly what you expect: an introductory survey class based off of memorization and fulfilling a Weinberg distribution requirement. As such, despite others' evaluations, actual work IS required. An easy class at Northwestern means that you are evaluated based on what you remember rather than critical analysis. Doing the readings are still necessary to some extent - judge for yourself what will help you know the material best for the test. Some material is not discussed in lecture and is solely from the readings, so take that as you will. There is no way of knowing where you stand in your participation grade, though I suspect it is based off of lecture attendance with effort in group work. I did not find this class too interesting, though I was forced to take this through Weinberg so if you are interested in linguistics or the history of Eastern Europe I expect you would enjoy this course! I did leave with a better understanding of ethnic and linguistic conflict in the Balkans.",
          "Very interesting topics",
          "easy class take it. Readings can be long at times.",
          "History Distro. Enjoy.",
          "Pretty easy class. Just make sure to do good on the quizzes and read (not really necessary though).",
          "This course was interesting in explaining why things are the way they are in the Balkans but if you really want to take this class, there is like a lot of material to cover",
          "This is great course for an ethics/values distro (or a history distro if you take Slavic 255, which is the same class, shared section). Professor Elliot's a great lecturer, and provides all the powerpoints online. She even makes study guides with all the material that you need to know for the midterm and the final. This class is an easy A if you simply go to lecture and do everything on the study guide.",
          "This class depends solely on TA grading. You get the questions to exams ahead of time so you can prepare. There is a lot of reading, but it is not super necessary to read it all. There is group work on the readings, but it is chill.",
          "Readings don't really help with your understanding of the course. Make sure to attend group work days as participation goes a long way. Exams not too bad.",
          "Good class. Lectures are a bit long and dry but Elliott is a great professor who is wiling to help. Picking a good group for the group work activities helps immensely, otherwise there will be a few people shouldering most of the work.",
          "learned a lot about Balkans",
          "You can take a different ethics distro, get a better grade, and actually learn something from it. This class isn't worth it.",
          "I didn't know anything about the Balkans prior to this class, and know I can have a proper conversation about it. Also, Prof. Elliott managed to convey her ideas in a very didatic way. It is a lot of content to cover, but she did a great job in choosing readings that went straight to the point and although the lectures were not essential (except by the fact she usually took attendance), they were always very interesting."

          "For a distribution requirement, I highly recommend taking this class (as long as it's with Clark). Big perks of no in-class exams, and problemsets you can collaborate with friends on, so really the most challenging part is getting to class every day as attendance is a key part of the grade. But other than that, it's definitely a class that you can take as a distro and not be disappointed at the end of the day.",
          "This course feels a little disjointed at times - I often felt like I was missing the overall point of the course, but I did learn some specific things about language which was cool! Brady's dope and his tattoos are so beautiful.",
          "This course isn't too time-intensive, and it is a great non-math formal studies option. HOWEVER, the problem sets are graded harshly and you will get tired of the \"this is the part fo the course where people hate me\" jokes after they are \"uttered\" for the nth time.",
          "As a person with a background in linguistics, let me say that this course was tough. The slides are confusing, the problem sets are difficult, and although Professor Clark is easy on the eyes, I dreaded having to go to class.",
          "I really enjoyed this class. The reading, lectures and homework were all very clear and purposeful -- no busywork -- and it was easy to learn. Brady is a great professor; he's funny and easygoing while also being thoughtful and smart. The class is a combination of theory and more number-based stuff, but it's a good balance, and they complement each other well. Basically would highly recommend this class. I took it as a distro but also was already interested in languages/linguistics, and I had a great time.",
          "I was kinda disappointed in this course because the content just seemed so convoluted and needlessly complicated.",
          "Brady was a great teacher! His sense of humor brightens up my day and his explanations are pretty clear. He's also really nice and helps you out if you need it. Take this class with him. There's just weekly assignments that aren't too bad, and take home finals and midterms. The second half of the class is slightly harder than the first but there isn't really a reason to do bad in this class.",
          "This quotes teaches you to evaluate the truth values of sentences and shows you different ways to use that information to learn more about the information given to us by the sentence",
          "DONT TAKE THIS CLASS FOR A DISTRO. People will tell you this class is boring; it is, but it's so much worse than that too. I took it with four friends and we all agreed we would've been better off just taking math or stats. Brady is a horrible lecturer with horrible lecture slides. Nothing is explained, nothing is clear, nothing is labelled. The saving grace of this class was that collaboration on homework was \"encouraged,\" and I would've failed out in a hot second if I hadn't been able to do the homework with my friends every week. NOT WORTH IT. DONT DO IT.",
          "I took this class for my formal studies distro and though it was not an easy class, I think I enjoyed this more than I would had I taken a regular math class. I really enjoyed learning more about language and structures, even though it gave me a headache basically every single time I walked in.",

          "This class is hard. Full stop. It's abstract, and a lot of the material is sort of up for interpretation. However, it will make you so much more aware of your own use of language, and a lot of the material is enlightening and relevant to everyday life. If you're the type of person who likes to solve puzzles, you\u027d probably do well in this class. If you like your information cut-and-dry, you'll find it extremely difficult.",

          "Class itself is what you make of it -- if you're interested in the material you'll probably enjoy it. Despite only taking it for a distribution requirement/not having much interest in the course, I enjoyed it because I loved Professor Clark! He's a great professor that also is cognizant of the fact that many of the students are just there for a requirement and is good at gauging where the class is. He's a really interesting and witty guy that makes the class cool.",
          "For a Formal Studies distro, it's better than a math class, but don't expect smooth sailing if logic isn't your thing. It alternates between relatively fun common sense work and ridiculously frustrating pseudo-math. May not be what you expect from a linguistics course, especially about meaning.",

          "This class was actually really cool and interesting, I wasn't really expecting it to be so logic/math based but that wasn't a bad thing. The class was this weird overlap between math, linguistics and philosophy, and was really cool. The weekly problem sets took an hour or two but manageable. The readings weren't mandatory but some of them were helpful on the problem sets since some of the questions were taken from them. The take home exams were hard and took a long time so don't put them off until the last minute and go to office hours.",

          "The lectures are more helpful than the readings so you can probably get by without doing the readings if you attend class. Office hours are also extremely helpful in doing the homework assignments (they get progressively harder). Honestly this course wasn't what I expected, but it's a decent formal studies distro.",

          "This is an interesting class, and I would recommend it as a formal studies distro if you're really not a math person. It was more challenging than I expected - try to take it with a friend so that you can work together on the homeworks. Grades are determined by a problem set per week, and then a take-home midterm and take-home final. The fact that everything was take-home is really helpful since you could look through your notes for all of them, but it's still hard. Some of the readings didn't seem completely related to what we learned in the course, and a few made things more confusing. Professor Potter is pretty relaxed during lectures and makes things fun for the class.",

          "DO NOT LET CTECS FOOL YOU. THIS CLASS IS HARD. However, it is extremely interesting. Expect problem sets to take a good chunk of time, but Potter is more than willing to work with you during his office hours. Let me repeat: GO TO OFFICE HOURS. Midterms are graded harshly.",
          "This was a pretty good class and not too time consuming outside of class",
          "This was not that bad of a class. Some of the material was slightly challenging, but the professor worked on us with things we didn't understand. He was very approachable and the course made me think differently about how I use language, in both English and in my language major. Overall, not too mathematical (some set theory and logic is as technical as it gets) and not too intensive. Perfect distro.",

          "This course requires a lot of learning if you are not familiar with linguistics and semantics as I was not. The midterm and the final, even though they are take-home, are incredibly hard. They are take-home for a reason, and even the extra time to do them does not help. There are weekly problem sets that aren't that bad because you can ask friends for help. A study group is necessary if you aren't confident in this subject.",

          "Professor Potter is a very charming instructor and always willing to spend more time on topics not understood and answer questions. The class is very straightforward and assignments just require you to spend time on them and sometimes do the readings. He explains things very well. Sometimes I wish we had more space to discuss about the philosophical interpretation and significance of the work we did in class as I was genuinely interested in the topic but sometimes the class felt to practical and we would not often take a moment to discuss what things really meant in the real world and how these abstractions helped us understand this.",
          "This class made me think more about how the structure of what I say influences what people think I mean... like that sentence, class could sometimes be confusing until you thought about it a lot. I could easily skip the readings and I was glad that Prof. Potter let classmates collaborate on the problem sets. Prof. Potter gave fun examples from pop culture, and was much easier to understand in office hours than in class itself at times. Not necessarily an easy distro, and some class topics were far more relevant to real English usage than others, but if you like language and are willing to go to office hours, take this class - and take it with your friends so they can help you!",

It might've been better with a different instructor, but mine was just not very helpful. I felt rushed by other students and the professor when I went to office hours for help.

          "Both instructors are very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject, and conveyed that in class. Of course, being the first time this class was taught, there were a few kinks in it that I'm sure will be fixed for the second time the class is taught. There were a few skills that we briefly covered in class, like Praat scripting, that I wish we would have spent more time on, and some that we did not get to cover that would have been nice to, like running basic statistics on some of the data. Overall, it was a good course that with minor adjustments will be a great course.",
          "It was clear that Matt and Jennifer were both very invested in this course and in giving students autonomy to develop and run their own research project. The readings we did for this class were interesting and gave students a taste of the types of projects that can be run with big data methods. I do wish we had spent more time discussing the readings rather than taking quizzes, which felt a little pedantic and meant that our understanding of the readings was not as deep as it could have been. I also really appreciated having the opportunity to modify some Praat scripts, which is a very useful skill, and would have loved to have more experience and practice with Praat scripting.",
          "",
          "While I understand this could not have been foreseen since it was the first time this course was offered, we spent 4 class periods choosing a topic for the final project, which left us with just two weeks to actually implement it. This led to undue stress and meant that we were scrambling to create data visualizations of the results at the end of the quarter, which could have been avoided with a faster topic selection process.",
          "",
          "Finally, despite being offered for both graduate and undergraduate students, it felt as though this class was targeted at undergraduates. By virtue of being a graduate student, I was not allowed to use the computer (be the \"driver\") in my pairs for much of the first half of the course, which limited my ability to gain firsthand experience in a software program that was new to me (Tableau) or learn skills that are actually likely to be valuable to my future research (Praat scripting). It was hard to balance my own learning needs with trying to allow undergrads to have a valuable learning experience as well. At one point in the quarter, graduate students were offered up as resources to be e-mailed over a weekend for help on a homework assignment, which felt unfair given that we were trying to complete the same assignment.",
          "It was obvious that both instructors were kind of making it up as they went along, which made for a very haphazard experience. In particular, the instructors seem to have poor understanding of group dynamics. Often we were put into teams where one grad student was \"in charge\" of an undergraduate; this made for a very unequal learning experience. A common complaint among the grad students was that they didn't feel confident working in Tableau because they hadn't had enough practice. Twice, I was put in charge of a larger group and given a task that was impossible to accomplish during the time allotted (yet crucial to the final project). Of course, at the time, I didn't realize that these tasks were impossible; they were given to me by instructors I trusted, so we must have been capable of accomplishing them. When we could not, I felt like it was a reflection on my leadership skills\u2014since I had been the leader, it must have been my personal fault that the team had failed. This has discouraged me from taking on further leadership roles in the future, outside of this class.",
          "While I have several critical points where I was not satisfied with this class, I appreciate the passion and intentions from Professors Goldrick and Cole. I am also keeping in mind that this is the first time that this class has been taught. However, my concerns with the structure of class time, assignments, and computer programs lead me to believe that this class did not help me engage with existing big data sound research, nor did it equip me to confidently work with large sets of data.",
          "This course was very experimental, and I felt like I was often left on my own as to how to understand a linguistic concept. The instruction on how to use Tableau was better, and I think it was a really cool tool to use that didn't require anyone to have lots of statistics or programming knowledge. The idea of creating our own experiment was also really cool, but we had such little time that it was executed really poorly. I think that if we had met more often or started earlier it could have been great.",
          "This class was really interesting! Working with Tableau was very fun and the class was set up in a good way to gain hands-on experience with the program. Sometimes assignments were vague and difficult to navigate, but overall not too bad. The experiment part of the class was a cool way to apply the knowledge we gained. Non-linguistics majors would probably struggle a bit in this class. It's a good idea to have a solid background in phonology (take Ling 250 at least) before taking this class.",
          "This course title may attract students that have a interest or background in both sound structure and data science. The wide breadth of topics covered and the lack of prerequisites may leave students with more developed knowledge of either of these topics wanting. The highly structured nature of the assignments and coursework may frustrate students who are able to come up with their own approaches to problems. Students without much of a background in computation or data science may still be well served by this course."

          "I enjoyed lecture. The fact that it was 3 hours long did not affect my learning. There are times when the readings are a bit too much, but if you manage your time well its doable. Essays are related to what we learn in lecture and the group work is pretty interesting as well.",
          "This is an amazing course and Dr. Berger is FANTASTIC!! She is very knowledgeable and had the course schedule and activities down to an exact science. All of the topics and concepts that we discussed in class are highly relevant to real-world management and leadership. Additionally, Dr. Berger made the 3 hours fly by with activities, discussions, and interactive lecture! Workload is moderate - approximately 100 pages of reading per week, some written assignments, one case study, and two large group projects. MAKE SURE TO STUDY HARD FOR THE FINAL. I think that the requirements for the group projects could have been communicated better\u2026 It's sad that this is her last quarter teaching the course :(",
          "Good class. Not a huge fan of only meeting once a week but the class doesn't seem like it takes 3 hours and the prof. really tries to get the class involved.",
          "I liked this course, although it was a 3 hour class. It dragged on a lot, but we did many other activities throughout each class; it wasn't just a lecture the whole time. But she did lecture for a lot of it. Lots of mini assignments and one exam. Not difficult at all. You get really close to the group you are assigned too",

The group projects can be a pain if you get stuck in a bad group, however this was not the case for me. The final was not bad but requires studying. 10/10 would recommend if you need an easy BIP field course!"

Sometimes the class periods could get a little long and repetitive, but that is just because it was a 3 hour class. Overall I feel like I learned a lot. Mindy was GREAT and seemed really excited about the material and was super helpful.",
          "Professor Dhoutit is a great professor! She is enthusiastic, patient, engaging, and an effective teacher. She really cares about her students and makes sure that everyone understands the material. I learned so much in this class. The three hours goes by quickly and she often lets students out early. I really enhanced my critical thinking skills and learned how to apply frameworks and theories to analyze and diagnose content from business cases. Truly, one of the most applicable classes I have ever taken.",
          "This class was amazing. Mindy is such an enthusiastic instructor and the material was very interesting.",
          "Great class, learned a ton! a lot of reading that takes time with a weekly 3 page response paper but if you do all the readings the class is very manageable. prof is awesome and always willing to help no matter the hour.",
          "This course is pretty difficult. The TA makes or breaks your grade because he/she grades the weekly assignments. The final group paper and presentation isn't that bad though. Also the class is 3 hours which really drags on. It's hard to stay focused in the class. Only take this course if you have to.",
          "Good class. Professor Douthit is great take it with her!!! The course consists of weekly papers (2-3 pages) that incorporates the theme from the week, a midterm paper (6 pages) and group final paper. Professor Douthit is great and she makes the 3 hours go by pretty fast.",
          "I really enjoyed the writing assignments due each week. Professor Douthit is amazing and I really learned a lot from her teaching methods. I would recommend this course to anyone!",
          "I also feel that the readings mainly adressed topics that are somewhat intuitive. There was also a very very significant amount of reading each week along with a 3-5 page paper and it was hard to not just get frustrated with the amount of material to synthesize weekly. I feel that if there had been less information and less reading I could have spent more time actually working on the writing",
          "Mindy is wonderful! This class is a decent amount of reading and writing, but it's manageable. It took a while to get feedback on some of the work we submitted, but overall this is a really good class.",
          "Great class. Mindy is awesome.",
          "Solid class, really highlights the change aspect of LOC.",
          "Professor Douthit is extraordinary, take this class with her!! This class really got me to see how to apply theory and frameworks to real life cases. I really enjoyed learning how to write in a new way, even though it was very different from the style that I was accustomed to from previous classes. She cultivates riveting discussions and rarely lectures, but when she does lecture, the class is still engaging. For other classes, I have felt like they were sometimes wasting my time, but I have never felt that way about this class and have always looked forward to coming to this one in particular.",
          "very straightforward course and professor douthit presents extremely clear expectations. if you do the readings (about 50 pages a week), you'll do fine on all of the short weekly papers and the final project will come easily.",

          "bethany is so intelligent and will go out of her way to answer any questions or concerns. this course is a great way to challenge the way you think about culture and cognition, and I highly recommend. weekly reading assignments and quizzes but not too much work overall",
          "A lot of reading, you learn to skim but the topics are really interesting. You get out of it what you put into it. I\u027d suggest the class to anyone interested or involved with any form of psychology- this offers a new perspective that I haven't seen in any other class",
          "Honestly not sure what this class was about but overall ok. A little too much work if you're taking it for the diversity distro"

This class is challenging to keep up with and stay engaged in but if you are able to keep up, the material is very well connected throughout the quarter",

          "Learned a lot in this course, must put in effort",
          "I was bored most of the time. There was not much content that got me excited about being in the class.",
          "Really enjoyed the class. Thought it brought culture and cognition together in interesting ways, cool readings. The final project wasn't explained super clearly and the responses being due at 2 pm the day before class was difficult because of other classes/work\u02fetc. Cool concepts but I thought sometimes the readings made broad generalizations between cultures and races that could perhaps be more divisive than educational.",
          "I liked the reading materials and they were very thought-provoking.",
          "I really enjoyed this class and recommend taking it with professor Ojalehto. Weekly assignments and in-class quizzes are not too bad once you get used to them. The final project allows you to pretty much study anything you want which is pretty cool.",
          "This course was graded fairly easily, but it was not particularly interesting as the information all seemed fairly basic. There was (literally) a reading response due the day before every single class, a quiz at the beginning of every class, an attendance grade for every class and a participation grade. This meant that we had all clearly done the readings before every class since we had to write a response paper over them and then take a quiz over them. BUT then the lectures that took the entire class were just the Professor summarizing the readings for us. AND we did not have any midterms or finals except for an independent research paper so there literally was not a reason for us to even learn this information, yet we were not allowed to use laptops in the class so the lectures felt like a pretty big waste of time. I felt like the entire point of the class was simply to get graded on random little things and never once actually facilitated learning. Only take this course to fulfill your SESP requirement if you absolutely have to as it is extremely frustrating.",
          "Interesting and good class, but pretty time consuming. There's a reading response due and an in class quiz consisting of 2-3 questions every class. Both were graded kinda harshly which actually brought down my grade a lot. Honestly, wasn't a huge fan of bethany, but the way she ran the class was stimulating and understandable.",
          "The class wasn't really what I expected. I was kind of frustrated that it seemed like the whole quarter was spent making really huge broad generalizations about various cultures and it felt kind of problematic. The course was really well organized however and easy to follow, and I liked that the final project gave us a chance to explore our own interests, and overall the outside of class assignments were not too hard either."

          "Overall, this was a great course. It is basically an introduction to consulting, so if you're interested in that career path, this is a class for you. The textbook was surprisingly interesting, and the papers were *almost* fun to write. However, the fact that class was 3 hours long (in the middle of lunch time) made it hard to focus. Oh, Mindy allows a cheat sheet for the final exam!",
          "I enjoyed this course a lot! I felt that it really helped me begin to think critically analytically about the origins of problems in organizations. The course didn't really focus much on concrete solutions, which is something that I expected it to, but I think that's fine because solutions can vary from case to case. Though we didn't cover that in class, I was not disappointed because there was so much other stuff to learn.",
          "This course was a great intro level course and Mindy is awesome!",
          "I really enjoyed this class. I think Professor Douthit did a good job trying to keep the class engaged despite some of the dry material. I also think that the team dynamic was very strong in this class.",
          "This course was not very challenging because a lot of what we learned was very intuitive. You know that all of this stuff is \"true\" or you have experienced some of it in practice, and the course just puts names and applies theories to it. A lot of reading but you don't really have to read all of it, you just have to understand the basic concepts and models which aren't hard. Two papers and one exam (where you get to use a big \"cheat sheet\"). Really easy major requirement for LOC and it is fun to work with a group the whole quarter. Love Douthit!!",
          "Weekly readings, easy reads, a couple papers, and a lot of group work.",
          "I loved that this course emphasized team work and organizations in practice. Professor Douthit was very engaging and made the class fun and practical.",
          "The course itself was pretty easy to follow and the homework was pretty sensible. Three hours is a very long time, and there isn't a ton of diversity in teaching methods, but the breaks help and it's easy information to listen to. The final project is not very challenging if you plan efficiently. Overall it's a pretty decent class.",
          "I learned a lot from the class and it made me realize that I want to continue being an LOC major! Learned a ton, wasn't too difficult but I feel like I absorbed so much information!!",
          "Mindy is an amazing professor. Pretty easy class and interesting too so highly recommend this class even though everyone has to take it at some point.",
          "very good class. you will learn a lot. mindy is the best",
          "Very interesting! Lectures are long but Douthit makes the class go by fast and she always gives us snacks! Lots of reading.",
          "The professor was great. She wanted us to succeed and showed it in every lecture and comment.",
          "Yes, yes, yes! Mindy is an amazing professor. She is prepared for class, she has real-world experience, and there was never a time when I doubted that she knew what she was doing/talking about. She is professional and treats students with respect and does a phenomenal job of facilitating discussion and challenging students to think critically. Even though this a longer class, she makes the class go by fast by using videos, presentations, activities, and group projects to keep everyone engaged. Such a wonderful class and an absolute delight.",
          "Professor Douthit is awesome. Definitely worth taking the course with her, although very introductory, she really gives you content and materials that are real-life applicable. Douthit is also a great professional resource to have and she loves helping her students in any way that she can.",
          "good class, professor mindy is great, reading notes due every week, final presentation, open note exam, and group paper",
          "GREAT CLASS! Professor Douthit is nice and knowledgable and makes class time fun and relevant to what we learn. We play games or do other activities to make the 3 hours go by faster. The actual class is not hard as long as you follow along and do the readings, and the only test is the final and you get a cheat sheet. Would highly recommend even if you aren't an LOC major.",
          "Overall a pretty good class and solid intro to organizations. Was hoping we would study the general concept of organizations but the focus was a little business-heavy rather than also looking at other types of organizations, and the course could be perceived as a crash course to consulting. Mindy is awesome and you still learn a lot about working hands-on in groups and about organizations.",
          "Professor Douthit is amazing. She delivered the material in an interesting way each class and was very clear on her expectations.",
          "I liked the course, but it was difficult at times because I felt like the professor expected everyone to understand the course readings perfectly, when we often did not. The midterm exam was much more challenging than expected and took nearly 3 hours to complete, which no one anticipated. The group project took a lot of work outside of the classroom and the grading was harsher than we expected.",

The material, however, was very straightforward, making the class feel as though it were dragging on for 3 hours. There is only a little homework involved, and it is easy to understand.",
          "Love this course and love Mindy. One of my favorite classes so far at Northwestern, 10\u2f10 would recommend",
          "Professor Douthit is an amazing teacher! Yes, three hours of class first thing in the morning is tough but Mindy keeps it actually engaging by splitting the class into lecture and an activity (we also take a break halfway through). There are only like 3 readings per week that you have to take notes for (to make sure you read them) but they take like no time and are pretty interesting. Other than a few assignments with your group (for the final group project) there is little work throughout the quarter-but it helps if you have a good group. Tbh the final was more dense and longer than I expected but still not too bad at all because Mindy lets you make a cheat sheet for the exam. The final project was actually pretty cool and the work is manageable! Def take with Mindy if you can!!",

          "2) MINDY is so sweet and amazing at conveying the topics she is presenting while keeping her students engaged and interested. Such a good resource and knowledge base on top of that.",
          "3) the group work is OK, it really subjectively depends on who you get placed with. Ultimately it ended up being a positive experience, but it DEF could have gone either way.",
          "I enjoyed the thought and care put into the course from the material to the groups, I think it was very well structured. For a long, 3 hour class, I did not mind it.",
          "This was a solid class overall! A good introduction to what LOC is like. Truly didn't have to put in a ton of time outside of class, just came to class once a week and did a few short readings for homework. There's group work centered around a quarterlong project which is manageable but does mean that you have to find time when everyone is available to meet. Don't be deterred by the 3 hour class: it goes by quickly and we were often let out early. Mindy kept class engaging and did a good job of applying what we were learning to real organizations, which was interesting! I didn't think Org Theory would be something I was interested in, but it's super applicable to everyday life. Solid!! Glad I took it.",

A few of the readings are interesting, but it doesn't move fast or hold your attention. Easy enough if it's required, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're really looking for a challenging and rewarding course.",

The project is essentially an idea that you and a team come up with and then pitch to visitors and the class. Super cool and fun if you get engaged and have a solid team.",

          "This course is really interesting if you're interested in innovation, but if not it can be hard to follow.",
          "The readings were enjoyable and gave us theoretical and methodological tools for conducting field observations and developing design solutions. I also found the field activities engaging. However, during the second half of the quarter the professor would tell us where we should be in the process of working on our group projects the NIGHT before the next class, which was stressful and made it difficult for us to keep each other accountable on the work we needed to be doing consistently throughout our project process. Workload is significant and really depends on how well your group works together, so keep that in mind.",
          "This class just isn't well organized. Prof. Stevens did not really give us an idea of how the course would play out over the quarter, and some weeks we had a ton of work and others we had virtually none. There was not enough time to plan for the final project, and the guidelines were unclear and did not give us a great idea of what the expectations were.",

Though we were not expected to implement the design, we had to show that it was implementable. It was a very interesting and applicable way of thinking but I felt that the course was spent too much on conceptual theory for the majority of the quarter and then the last three weeks were spent working with the group, which felt very rushed. A good balance would have been conceptual theory for half the quarter and group work for at a minimum the remaining five weeks."

          "Peter was a great professor for this class, and made it super applicable to real life and a valuable course to take. Not too much work, tough for 3 hours but good conversation/interesting",
          "Not a very hard class. Reading snapshots every week are actually a decent way of making sure you understand what's going on. Not a ton of work and final is a group project with individual papers.",
          "Overall great course and would recommend. Very relevant and connected reading for every week and most of them are pretty interesting. 3 papers that are fun and interesting to write and a very fun and interesting group project at the end of the quarter. Peter and the TA Alize care a lot about their students and are very passionate about the class which enhances it a lot.",
          "The final project for this class is a lot of work but is actually really fun",
          "Overall, a solid course. Workload is manageable - there's a decent amount of reading and several papers, and a longer final - similar workload to LOC 211 overall, perhaps slightly more. The class itself is interesting, Peter did a great job of keeping the class relevant and providing breaks (3 hour classes are brutal but there's no way around it). I still don't really understand what this class is about, it covered so many topics, but in general it was enjoyable and not too difficult",
          "This class is really great to learn and not very stressful. Lots of discussions which are useful and interesting.",
          "Overall a decent course. Definitely frustrating in the beginning because the name \"cognition in contexts\" implies something entirely different from what we were actually doing, which fell more along the lines of an intro to design class. Some of the material was fairly interesting, other material was not. Lots of reading and the reading notes could be time-consuming but sometimes it was interesting. A lot of the other students would speak up just to share irrelevant personal stories and hear themselves talk which was kind of annoying, but despite the frustrations you learn a lot in the class through the hands-on work you do.",
          "Good class! Weekly reading assignments can be annoying - but they are helpful for the final paper! Discussions are great!",
          "I actually really enjoyed this class!!! You learn a lot, but it's not hard really. The weekly memos were kind of annoying but that's better than having a midterm. Final project at the end.",
          "This is one of the most informative classes I've taken at Northwestern. The readings are all relevant to the in-class activities and to the final, and despite being a 3 hour lecture, I was able to stay interested and engaged for almost the entire class.",
          "This is a GREAT class! It is a lot about design so be prepared for that. I think it would be more accurately described as \"Design for Contexts\" but it's a fun course. Lots of work though, for a SESP course, so be prepared for that",
          "Good Course. Laid back and can focus on the material and not worry about your grade 24\u02f7"

Lectures are well-paced and broken up for a 3 hour class. The papers are easy and the professor and TA give helpful feedback that you can use to help you on the final paper. The final project is a group project. Groups are assigned. If you get stuck in a bad group, the workload towards the end of the quarter can be brutal.",

          "This class can be interesting at times with how we go about with design and redesigning things but at other times it can be boring and repetitive. The readings can get a little boring because it seems that some readings are saying the same thing and the notes are easy but get boring and annoying to do towards the end of the quarter, but they are helpful when writing the final paper. Class in general felt long sometimes, but Peter gave breaks and tried to have it be more hands on than lecture which really helped! Overall, its a good class!",

It was mainly teaching things that were common sense, but drawing them out into a 3 hour course of silly activities to explain a concept that was easily understood. I think if I took this as an underclassman it would have been more valuable and enjoyable, but as a senior taking her last LOC class it lost value.",

The learning briefs for this class were structured a little differently from the past analytical papers I had to write for other LOC courses. I enjoyed working on the group presentation, which is not graded, but I felt that we spent too much time on it over the course.",

As long as you do the reading the assignments are easy.

          "This course seemed almost more structured like a graduate school course. Lots of openness to share ideas and person thoughts. All contributions and questions are appreciated. The professor is spunky and very knowledgable. She genuinely enjoys teaching, which comes across. The reading and the assignments are not too bad. 3 learning briefs (2 page reflections about the reading), midterm (in class and opgennote), a group project, and a final exam (take home)",
          "The class consisted of three papers, one midterm, a final project, and either a final paper or exam. Professor Blesoff is clearly passionate about what she is teaching us, and I enjoyed having the class once a week for three hours. She kept us engaged by implementing fun exercises throughout the three hours. I never felt as though I was sitting for too long.",
          "Didn\u2019t like this class at all, the conflicting theories being taught were irritating as well as the grading method on the midterm. One of the worse LOC classes.",
          "There are 3 two-page reading reflections, a take home final, and a group presentation. Very low key 3 hour class, you often kind of forget about it until the day it comes around again.

          "This class was awesome. Shirin is so intelligent and kind and actually cares about her students. Going to class was enjoyable because class discussions seemed to always further my I understanding on class concepts rather than just reiterate previous readings. The class is a lot of writing but as someone who doesn\u2019t love writing, I promise it\u2019s not painful. The assignments are actually interesting and it doesn\u2019t usually feel like busy work. It\u2019s a really awesome class that changed how I look at social hierarchies and the world in general.",
          "the professor is incredible and the course was super interesting. it really expanded your view. however it is SO MUCH WORK you have a crazy amount of assignments every week: reading notes on long readings every monday by 7 pm; 2 page papers on multiple readings every other wednesday by 7 pm; and 6 page papers every other wednesday by 7 pm with final drafts due sunday afternoon. just a lot of work overall so dont take this course if you dont have time. however most of the assignments are graded fairly easily so its more so about applying yourself rather than super hard grading. except in the beginning they grade hard but go off the hard edge quickly. interesting and stimulating but a lot of work.",
          "This class is a lot of work but Shirin is an incredible lecturer and the subject matter is super interesting. This class really led me to think more critically about the way I view the world.",
          "I would not recommend taking this course unless you absolutely have to. It's a ton of work, class is not super interesting, and it doesn't touch on anything that will make you see the world differently or that you will bring into another course. If you're LOC, take LOC 308 instead.",
          "TONS of assignments to turn in, while the readings are interesting you are constantly turning in work which can get tiring but class itself was interesting and engaging",

          "amazing class!!!! a lot of work but it is all interesting and cool",
          "prof shirin really gave us the tools to write our own narratives, felt meaningful to the self",
          "TAKE THIS WITH SHIRIN. This class will change the way you approach all of your other classes, really alters the way you think and challenge your own ideas. I fought my way into this class from the waitlist and I'm SO thankful that I received this opportunity to think so critically and study with one of the best professors in SESP, if not Northwestern. I spent too much time on the assignments but they were really helpful to engage with the material (3 major papers that end up being around 4 pages single-spaced, plus weekly writing assignments and reflections). Lots of work but so worth your time and effort.",
          "Very good course. Professor Vossoughi challenges you to think and innovate and is very good with feedback. A lot of work is my only complaint.",
          "Take this class with Vossoughi if you have the option to. She is a wonderful teacher and makes the subject tangible and interesting. This is my favorite SESP class I've taken so far and I learned a ton. I would highly recommend.",
          "This class has helped me develop my writing, reading, and thinking\u02fanalytical skills.",
          "This class was hands-down my favorite class I've taken at Northwestern. I came in with little knowledge about what it meant to have conversations surrounding social inequities, and at the conclusion of the class it became one of my favorite topics of conversation, even though I never thought that would be me! I loved the readings we did (always super relevant, interesting, and they tied back to one another) and how the readings tied to our discussions surrounding our personal experience. I think my writing improved a lot because of this class. We were encouraged to \"think on paper\" and use personal experience in our writing, which was really empowering. I enjoyed working on every writing assignment and felt like every class opened my eyes to a new perspective on the world. Shirin is amazing, one of the most thoughtful, creative and intelligent professors at NU. I loved loved loved it. Please take it if you have the chance, you will be so happy you did! :)",
          "This course is a lot of work, but it was engaging and interesting the whole time.",
          "veryyyy time consuming course, but you learn a lot",
          "Vossoughi is the BEST teacher and this was probably my most favorite class I have taken in my two years at Northwestern. While there is a good amount of reading and writing, it is all interesting and worth your time. The class time is also very interesting, making it an exciting class to look forward to each week.",
          "Shirin is such a kind and engaging professor. While the class is a lot of work, it is all super interesting. Her and Ruben also gave a lot of feedback on each assignment, which helps for improving future assignments.",
          "ABSOLUTELY AMAZING COURSE - MUST TAKE. Don't let the syllabus shy you away - it takes a pretty decent amount of work, but it is worth it.",
          "This class is ALOT of work. Not extremely challenging, but definitely alot. There were assignments every class. Mini papers 2-3 times a week and required reading every class. However, this class was great. There are few classes that I can say I enjoyed and learned alot. Take this class. You wont regret it"

          "This course was great. The weekly reading notes and reflections were very helpful to compile up for the Notebook of the Mind essays. I loved how relaxed this course was. I also loved the fact that this course was not focused on grades but rather learning. This is how I learn the best and when I learn in a class like I did in this one, I enjoy it 100 times better.",
          "I didn't understand some of the readings but I liked how we talked about them as a class and in small groups. The class was mainly discussion based. Professor Hooper wants each of her students to succeed and has an interesting learning sciences background that provided us with the opportunity to develop ideas through Notebooks of the Minds assignments. I did not enjoy the weekly reading notes and reflections as much for assignments. I wish feedback for the assignments is given earlier. I think the class could benefit from using each class to go over ideas or terms that are confusing. There was one class where we went over how all of the different authors' ideas were different and how the ideas were related in order to create a study guide -- doing this more often would be helpful. Overall, I am glad I took this course because it changed how I view culture and cognition.",
          "Dr Hooper is a wonderful professor who really cares about her students. It can at times be a bit hard to discern what is going on, but you don't have to worry about grades, meaning that it's ok to try something new and fail.",
          "At first, the class seemed weirdly structured, as Dr. Hooper makes the structure of each class exactly the same. But as the quarter progresses, assignments get more interesting. There is an assignment due each class, which was kind of a lot and makes you do all the readings. If you put minimal effort into the class, however, you should get an A.",

          "This course was extremely interesting concepts and very reflective, but not the best execution",
          "Great class with many interesting ideas that can be applied to any discipline. Readings were awesome!!",
          "I liked this class, but the assignments often felt tedious to make sure I was doing the reading. It challenged me to think in new ways, but I did not really like it. We were asked to read for class and discuss in our small groups, but our small groups often did not understand the articles well either and it just magnified the confusion. At times, i felt that the group activities were just not like college activities. We were often given sticky note posters and asked to share with the class, but it was the same people sharing each time. I don't think it was taught at the college level."

          "Prof. Colyvas is one of my favorite professors I've ever had. She really wants everyone to learn, she is very fair and invested in her students. The class is not vey time consuming. You have to read one or two studies every week which are usually interesting and write a short memo on them. The final project is the only other assignment and Prof. Colyvas gives you tons of time in class to work on it and get her feedback. The class is very laid back - first half is usually discussion of the readings and learning concepts, the last hour is time to work on your project -- and you can leave early if you really want to. Great LOC course.",

There is a fair amount of reading some weeks, but you learn a lot about reading journals and studies and you take a lot away from it.",

Also the readings are very difficult and the weekly memos were graded kind of hard lowkey. Idk, i\u027d take it bc there's no midterm, but the final project is super in depth and specific. Ask for her help a lot. she loves to help. For LOC majors take SESP 303 with Danny Cohen instead to fulfill the requirement.",

This class can be slightly long at 3 hours every week, but there are lots of interesting theories to be learned about organizational functions. The readings can be boring, but as long as you understand the main point and takeaways you should be fine. Work-intensive class but not difficult.",

I really enjoyed the final project, which was a research proposal for a question that you were interested in and got to choose with your group. I learned a lot about research design but felt that it was because my group sought out help rather than it being taught to us. Groups that didn't seek as much help had research designs that were missing key components. Professor Colyvas is really knowledgeable and passionate about her subject matter. Even though class was during dinner hours, which is when my energy levels are low, I always looked forward to going to her course.",

I pull a lot of all-nighters on Sundays because of the way all my classes had things due on Monday and Tuesday every week, so this class became very hard to bear.",
          "too much work, final paper is really long, weekly assignments, not really interesting unless you're interested in the subject. not really for me",
          "I really enjoyed this class.",
          "This was a really great applicable class. Highly recommend",
          "Definitely one of my favorite courses at NU. It's such a relevant and effective course for the LOC major. I didn't take 214 but I'm glad I chose to take 213 instead.",
          "I took this class just as a major requirement, but it turned out to be one of the best ones I've taken so far. Reed is a very engaging and knowledgeable professor, and even though the classes are 3 hours long they go by quite quickly. Good balance of individual papers and group work with very fair grading. The final project was a significant group time commitment, but being able to choose your own group and project topic definitely helped. Would definitely recommend!",
          "FANTASTIC, truly a unique course among LOC courses",
          "Interesting content and materials, lectures are okay, final project is manageable",
          "Probably the best class I have taken so far at Northwestern. Class is very hands-on and the main project forces you to learn by doing and how to create meaningful change",
          "This course was interesting and engaging but some of the assignments were unnecessarily long. Weekly reading snapshots kind of got old but you learn how to manage them. The group project and the end was the most beneficial for me. Make sure you get into a good group for the final project. The final paper was long, but it was interesting. The professor and TA were always available to help. Not a bad course. The 3 hour class made it somewhat boring at times though.",
          "The class was fine. I feel as though there wasn't enough support on the final project and the instructors give really loose guidelines which make completing assignments tricky. Class is a long 3 hours. The professor is enthusiastic and knowledgable, but doesn't always use class time efficiently. He kind of drones on and we spend too much time discussing the reading.",
          "Fantastic course. Prof. Stevens knows leaders in the field, is doing what he's teaching and makes the class applicable to many parts of life. A lot of work, but you'll get a lot out if you put a lot in.",
          "There wasn't a whole lot of work and the work we did do wasn't very hard",
          "It was a very interesting and manageable class. Weekly snapshots can take a while, but the readings are interesting. Fieldwork assignments are also fun!"

I enjoyed the topics of his class very much, and feel that this will probable be the most lax course out of the music history sequence.",
          "This class was one of the least stimulating course I have taken at Northwestern. Prof. Rosenberg's lectures were often filled with self-serving intellectual questionings without any clear point or drawn historical narrative.",
          "Unfortunately, I did not find that I was introduced to many new topics in this course -- it focused mainly on repertoire, and I was already familiar with the majority of what was covered. I wish that the course had focused more on compositional trends and historical events that occurred during the period.",
          "Professor Rosenberg is excellent! Workload is very light and grading system is fair.",
          "When Rosenberg talks, I enter another dimension. Stingy with the lecture notes though.",
          "Rosenberg is an utterly lovely man. He provides a very fresh spin on historical concepts and always entertains as well as educates.",
          "Filled with asinine assessments designed to test how well you can memorize and promptly forget information. Deeply irritating grading policies (eg. taking 10% off of virtually everyone in the class for double spacing an assignment where we were not told to single space), and not enough depth in any of the content to actually be interesting.",
          "I felt that I learned very little in this course. The fact that we were quizzed on things like Chicago Citations and Musical Catalogues didn't help at all.",
          "Professor Rosenberg is definitely a great professor. Of course, the material itself is pretty dry and boring, but he makes the class bearable. The grade distribution is pretty clear, and it's definitely an almost guaranteed A- or A if you study for the quizzes. He gives you what to study for the quizzes, so make sure you study those. The worst part of this entire course is the final research paper which is 8-10 pages. Unfortunately, we didn't really get any guidance on the paper. It's only worth 15% of our grade, but still, it would have been nice to have a bit more guidance on choosing our topics or for research. The final is take-home, and you can pretty much answer all of the questions as long as you do some of the readings and pay marginal attention in class.",

He is understanding and not too demanding. But the TA..... don't even get me started. She is obsessed with having the class pass around a written attendance sheet (already this idea is very \"high school\") and honestly this interrupts the class so much as people have to stand up to pass it around and then eventualy pass the sheet back to her. What year are we in? There are plenty of online attendance websites.",

It is very interesting to see how pieces that are equally famous during the time ends up differently now. Just make sure you don't fall behind on the reading.",

I was mostly interested in the stories and the lives of the composers we come across all the time in our industries, but I found myself most concerned with the listening quizzes. I did learn a lot from listening, even with the overwhelming amount we had to do, but I still would have liked to learn more about the historical influences on certain instrumental composers.",

She often would not correct the class when we sing a wrong note while arpeggiating a chord or sight-singing unless someone questions it. She regularly messed up chords in the harmonic dictations and would have to restart each play-through. She had a hard time keeping tempo while playing melodic and rhythmic dictations on the piano. This was so bad on the final that even though she gave us 2 extra listens on top of the normal 6 times, most if not all of the class still had no idea where each measure began and what rhythm she was attempting to play. Even though she was very nice and very accommodating about performance check times, it was still an extremely frustrating quarter."

          "This course does an adequate job of teaching the basic skills of what we're supposed to learn. I think it would be useful to just do more singing. I suppose sightsinging is very useful for me, and I would like more practice in singing complex harmonies and challenging aural examples.",
          "Having aural skills is something I think is important for a musician but I don't think this class facilitates improving these skills well",
          "It's fine. I can't say the class was especially engaging, but I learned what I needed to learn.",
          "Dr. Carter is a nice man. Consistent and fair, and for the most part will not waste your time. Reinhart's curriculum is brutally ineffective, however.",
          "Carter is much better than a lot of TAs but you have to be sure to go out of your way to find what you need to work on because a lot of class time could be better spent being in a practice room doing exercises by yourself, not in pairs",
          "Good class with a lot of different activities to focus on improving skills.",
          "Dr. Carter does a fine job of teaching a frustrating curriculum imposed by the department. We've now left the realm of usefulness and are into a land of frustration, angst, and overall monotony. We don't have a choice not to take this though, so what's there to say? I wish there was more sight singing in class.",
          "This course is fine and you have to take it",
          "I thought my teacher was great and responsive, he was very knowledgeable and cares a lot about his students' success in the course, but I am not entirely sure about how much this class is needed for me to succeed as a musician in the real world.",
          "I found this course to be mostly challenging although I did not always feel intellectually challenged in class particularly. The homework and material itself was challenging enough.",
          "I feel like I've gotten more adept at pitch identification and rhythmic and melodic dictations, however harmonic dictations are a dirty gnarly beast that can be skewered with a hot iron.",
          "Some people are just naturally better at aural skills and its hard to catch up because you can't really control what you hear but there's a little part that you have control over like the prepared stuff and learning the possibilities of chord progressions"

          "I loved the course, I learned a ton about the spanish language and culture. I'm still kinda shitty at spanish but it was fun regardless.",
          "Professor Amorese was the best! We reviewed vocab and grammar during class in partner activities which was helpful in solidifying the grammar/vocab we learned from the homework assignments. We did have a quiz almost every week but I preferred that because it gave me a chance to review the information and also have more grades besides just the 2 tests, compositions, and homework.",
          "The course was a good one, in which we tried to focus on speaking the language as the best way to learn it.",
          "I really enjoyed the course and feel prepared to move to the next level.",
          "I didn't expect to learn so much Spanish in such a short period of time, especially when I had never studied the language before. Classes do move very fast and its important to try and keep on top of vocabulary. Profesora Amorese is very enthusiastic and made coming to class enjoyable. However, I do feel that she is a pretty harsh grader compared to what my friends have said about their professors in other 101 classes.",
          "I was not looking forward to taking Spanish, but the class was still somewhat interesting because we didn't purely focus on vocab and grammar. Sometimes the homework assignments felt more like busy work, but most of them helped me be prepared for class and understand the material.",
          "First, this course is very good and I would highly recommend it to a new Spanish student. If you have any Spanish background however, it will probably be all review. Professor Amorese is very passionate about Spanish and is very good at communicating ideas, assigning relevant work, and designing tests that assess acquired skills. Quizes are frequent, but helpful in keeping the whole class at the same level.",
          "It's a lot of learning Spanish outside of class and sometimes it does get very frustrating. But professor Amorese is extremely understanding and is a great teacher with a lot of enthusiasm.",
          "I loved this course!",
          "This was overall a great course. It was very introductory, but that was helpful to me since I had never taken Spanish before. The workload wasn't too much, but it was just enough for me to feel like I was actually learning valuable language skills. If you are at all considering learning Spanish, take this class, and take it with Amorese!",
          "This course required a lot of small assignments outside of class because we spent most of class speaking. We also took several quizzes throughout the quarter. We covered a lot of content in a short amount of time. It was a lot of work, but we really learned a lot. If you can, take this course with Professor Amorese. She is a tough grader, but she is very enthusiastic and made the class more fun!",
          "I really enjoyed this course because it wasn't too challenging, but we learned a lot.",
          "This was a great introductory course for starting out in the Spanish language! Professor Amorese was energetic and very helpful when any material was confusing. As long as you stay on top of the homework and take time to practice the vocabulary and grammar concepts, this class was not too hard."

He was really good at leading the discussion in class and gave us helpful worksheets that really boosted our knowledge while also giving us cultural information. What I did not like was the Pearson MySpanishLab work, which felt like a waste of time. It was not helpful at all in my mastering of material. Professor Colom-Mena was not a fan of it either, but we had to do it, because the Spanish department makes us. Buying the access code feels like a waste of $150.",

          "This was a fantastic course! You learn so much about Spanish history, culture, and contemporary life. The course material was very engaging and thorough, as it's a combination of modules, articles, short videos, and films. The class was very comprehensive. We discussed course material, but also had plentiful conversations and debates comparing Spain to the U.S. Reyes is a fantastic instructor who deeply cares about the subject, and she knows how to engage the class.The best part of the course are the mesas redondas. These are discussions with 4-5 classmates about the films you watch for the course (there are 2). This was a great way to practice speaking skills in a relaxed environment.",
          "You'll learn a lot about Spanish history and present-day issues in the country; be prepared to speak Spanish constantly and not care if you mess up! Reyes is a fun, theatrical and encouraging professor who really wants you to succeed. The class itself is pretty easy; make sure to do the homework or you'll let your classmates down. There's no place to hide if you don't know what you're talking about.",
          "There was a lot of busy-work to do at home, but class was very interesting and engaging.",
          "I liked this class a lot. Didn't focus on the language or grammar of spanish very much but learned a lot of interesting stuff about Spain as a country",

The professor is really knowledgeable on the book. Class got dry at times since it really is just the professor lecturing for 50 minutes, and attendance is mandatory, but it's not hard at all.",
          "Professor Fernandez-Morera has a lot of knowledge on the content and DQ itself is a very interesting/humorous read. But because the class is highly reading based, it becomes very stressful if you fall behind on readings, which is easy to happen after the first midterm when the readings pick up. I would take this class if you have some time in your schedule. Overall a good class.",
          "This course is a good lesson in time-management! You only need one 1000+ page book for this class. There's a midterm, a final, and weekly discussion sections. We were allowed to take home the essay portion of the final and complete quick quote identification during the exam time. Lecture is fine. It can be a little early for some (10am) and the professor speaks softly, so you might lose focus easily, but other than that, two thumbs up. Don Quixote is extremely interesting and an easy read. Be sure to keep up with the reading guide or be ahead. It's too easy to skip one day and end up falling behind.",
          "i really liked the book, and the class is totally manageable.",

          "I was really eager to come in and learn further about a book that I've known and loved for so long, but there seemed to be little to no enthusiasm from the other students, and sometimes the professor himself.",
          "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! this class is perfect: EASY and INTERESTING. I've always wanted to read Don Quixote because its a classic and everyone should read it, but i know that if i tried to read it on my own i wouldn't have appreciated it as much as i do now that I've been taught Don Quixote in a class setting. this class is super easy and low key, only homework is reading Don Quixote and there is 1 easy midterm and a final that is mostly take home. it's clear that the professor is passionate about Cervantes' works and Don Quixote, but he is a little hard to understand. you have to go to class to succeed.",
          "GREAT class! The professor is really enthusiastic about Don Quixote and I love the book because of his insight. If you ever thought about reading Don Quixote, I would STRONGLY recommend this class because it will illuminate way more than you might have picked up on just reading by yourself.",
          "The class discussions and lectures were informative but rather dry. If you want to specifically learn about Cervantes and Don Quijote, then this is a great class, but if you are looking for a distro and have no prior interest in Don Quijote, you may want to look elsewhere."

          "Great lit class if you're interested in Latino Studies. I really enjoyed all of the pieces that were chosen for this class which helped understand latinos in the US and latino literature as a literary cannon.",
          "This class is really easy, at least the way Professor Aparicio teaches it a lot of the books are repetitive, and kind of about the same thing. TA Maria is really great, she writes extensive commentary on all of the short papers, does her best to hand these back in a timely fashion so we can apply her notes to are next paper and is a really fair grader. I think a big problem I had with Professor Aparicio was that she didn't really create an environment where people were comfortable to share their reactions to the material, especially not students who were non-Latino\u02fa. Sometimes she would respond to non-Latino\u02fa students' comments as though to suggest that they were not warranted to make observations about this literature, or that they were generalizing. Of course these kinds of comments are going to be generalizations; it is understood even of social science research that because it requires the compilation of several specific and variant cases into one analyses, the conclusions drawn are generalizations, and can contradict personal experience. I also think its inappropriate to call out specific students in the class for being Latino\u02fa, it really divides the class into people who have \"a right\" to speak on behalf of the Latinx community and the people who do not, and who therefore should not be commenting on Latino\u02fa literature. And then she wonders why nobody speaks up in class.",
          "I really enjoyed professor Aparicio's teaching style. She is very accessible to students and allows many interpretations of the text in class discussions. The timing of assignments is not ideal. We did not have a lengthy writing assignment until week 5 and then three more jammed in the last three weeks of the class followed by the final. In general, though, this is a great course, very interesting material, and not overly demanding.",
          "Take this class! I loved it. Did a lot of group work, but the readings were so manageable and so interesting. Aparicio wants to know how you feel about the readings so speak up. Only thing I did not like was how we had Canvas posts due the morning before class day, so definitely no procrastinating allowed.",
          "This is a great class to take. The work load is light however I did wish there was more group discussion so that the class doesn't get boring.",
          "Overall a great course. I was disappointed by a lack of classroom engagement at first, but it didn't take aware from the course material, which was fantastic. Aparicio is an amazing professor and she makes each class enjoyable.",
          "Amazing class. Loved the readings, the professor, and the discussions. Readings are pretty easy to keep up with and are often really interesting to read. Only four 2 page essays, weekly discussion prompts, and a final paper, so it was very manageable.",
          "This was a great course. All of the texts were interesting and Aparicio did a great job of pointing out the most important ideas of every text.",
          "class is not too hard, 4 essays and one final essay 8-10 pages, try to participate in class or you will lose a lot of points, can only miss class twice",
          "I really enjoyed this class! As a Spanish major, I will say I didn't know before that THIS CLASS IS TAUGHT IN ENGLISH! Regardless, we talked a lot about the latino\u02fa/x experience in the US and the stereotypes, myths, and realities associated with that experience. All of the poetry and novels we read were actually really interesting and enjoyable to read. We had responses to the reading due at 9 AM the days before class, which was sometimes stressful but nice because it forces you to get the homework done a few days before class. We had around four 1-2 page papers, where you analyzed the text and a final 8-10 page paper. IF YOU ARE A SPANISH MAJOR, and NOT a native Spanish speaker, it's definitely difficult to translate the discussions you have in class into a paper because apart from the responses all of your essays have to be in Spanish. Just be aware it's very doable but was definitely more difficult",
          "this class was super interesting and made me think a lot more about latinidad and what i means. i liked almost all of the texts that professor aparicio picked.",
          "The lecture was great and really stimulating. I enjoyed reading the texts because they were all very eye opening and offered a different aspect of Latino history. Even if you're not Latino you should take this course because it offers a better understanding of how Latinos have been treated in the U.S., and how literature has been affected.",
          "This was a fun and interesting course, but I felt that the prompts for the papers, which are 10% of your grade each, could have been a lot more specific and that the grading on them was a bit hard to follow, as in sometimes it felt like there was an answer that was expected."

          "This class was very disorganized, and I'm not sure what I learned from it. Fernandez-Morera is a nice man, but this class was unpredictable. We had no idea when we would be giving presentations and received little feedback on the work we did do. He is extremely knowledgeable about the topic of medieval Iberia, and I wish I could have learned more in this class.",
          "We didn't exactly stick to the syllabus, and the course was pretty dull at times, but overall it was relatively easy and pushed me to think in new ways about ancient texts.",
          "The material is interesting but the class is pretty disorganized and we fell super far behind schedule. Final presentation (25% of grade) and final paper (50% of grade) topics are assigned by the professor but there's still a good amount of flexibility in what direction you want to take with those, and the shorter response papers are pretty open-ended and you can choose something that interests you.",
          "Fernandez-Morera is the best professor I've had at Northwestern. There are various response papers\u02ffive minute orals based on the readings. Then, you are assigned a subject for a 20 minute presentation and 8 page paper. Those are the only real assignments of the quarters.",
          "Overall, the assignments are pretty straightforward, this class is bound to fall behind",
          "Interesting course, your grade will be based on 3-5 5 min oral response, a 20 min oral report, and a paper in the end.",
          "Pretty laid-back course. The majority of the class is student-run through presentations and the like, which can be good or bad. The class lost focus midway through the course and struggled to stay on schedule. The final paper still gave an opportunity to examine a topic in-depth, which was nice. Dario F-M is wonderful as always, but he could have done more lecturing in the later stages of the class to keep things more focused.",
          "Pretty disorganized course. Primarily student presentations, I wish Professor Fernandez-Morera would have lectured more because that's when the class was at it's strongest. Oh well, still very little work and the subject matter is interesting if you like history."

          "This course was a good course to solidify basic Spanish skills to be able to read, write, and speak the language effectively. The course was structured in a way that allowed students to get what they put into it but it was not necessarily challenging. Sometimes the homework or requirements on projects were unclear, but Rifka was really good at helping students who reached out her with any questions.",

The class itself was also not too bad, as long as you watch the movies she assigns and understand them, you're looking at a solid grade, probably an A. Just talk in class and talk to Rifka!

She assigns two hour long movies during the week, and often assigns several hours worth of readings and worksheets even as she expresses concern about our stress levels. She grades very harshly- I don't believe it is possible to get an A without perfect use of accent marks. Expectations are unclear for most of the written work, but all of the conversational parts of class are very helpful. Even though I hated this class, I am more fluent than I was at the start.",
          "Asha is amazing! I\u2019m so happy I took this class with her. I liked that we broke into small groups to discuss and put what we\u2019ve learned in practice. I liked that we discussed movies and poems, as well as important social issues. Asha made class very fun and comfortable",

Keep in mind that you will watch some movies, but otherwise, the homework is pretty chill. In-class group work felt forced and painful to me, but other aspects of the course were fine. Also, the textbook is exorbitantly overpriced imo, and I wish we didn't have to purchase it."

But if you are trying to actually learn Spanish, I would recommend somebody else. If you remember Spanish from high school, you don't really need to study more than the required assignment, which is, to be honest, annoying sometimes.",
          "It's very easy to get a high grade, with a little bit of effort. I went into the midterm and final with 30 minutes of studying beforehand, and still managed to get above a 95%. It's worth the investment to get the textbook, but the optional grammar booklet is unnecessary if you can utilize online resources. Points were fairly well-spread, from discussion, homework, tests, and writing assessments. Homework load is quite low, and syllabus clearly says the dates in which these assignments are due.",

          "Good continuing spanish class if you want to review high school and ensure you're prepared for college level classes",
          "A lot of work outside of class but it was good practice",
          "The course is a lot of work, including watching movies and reading stories/poems. There's online homework and writing homework along with the reading and watching. The stories and movies were difficult to understand but the discussions afterwards in class helped us to better understand the material. The discussions in class were often interesting and the professor was good at facilitating them. The homework was manageable and the tests weren't very difficult as long as you studied.",
          "This was a fun class. I feel like I definitely improved my Spanish speaking abilities, and the exams and quizzes really force you to learn the new grammar points. Watching and discussing movies was fun though some were very long. Super site is helpful for learning the vocab and practicing the grammar. Professor Villanueva is really fun, laid back and nice. Overall I enjoyed this course.",
          "The movies and readings were difficult to understand, but review in class made them manageable.",
          "This course helped me improve on my Spanish language skills. I learned a lot of new material that I never learned before. There are a lot of homework assignments, but they help prepare for the quizzes and exams.",
          "this class can be a bit boring sometimes if you're already good with grammar, but you can learn a lot about Hispanic culture. there are lots of great in-class activities too",
          "This class will help you improve your speaking and writing skills.",
          "Teresa is not too hard and I had a fun class group which made taking a Spanish class (something I didn't want to do) a more enjoyable experience."

It is helpful and immersive, but the grammar lessons are often rushed and pushed to the side. The homework is mostly online through an online course (this means you have to purchase books new...) It's mainly multiple choice or true\u2ffalse which can be problematic for subjective questions.",

There are readings before every class; make sure you read and go to class prepared to discuss them as your grade heavily depends on it.",

Class discussions were very helpful in understanding, but they could also be very stressful if you didn't fully understand the readings and therefore did not have very insightful things to say about the text. However, I enjoyed many of the texts that we read, and thought that discussions were interesting. The papers were kind of difficult to write, but they really helped me improve my literary analysis and Spanish writing skills.",
          "Pretty interesting class. I found discussions to be intimidating sometimes, especially because some readings were difficult and Nathalie is not afraid to tell you if she disagrees with your interpretation. But overall, got to read some interesting literature, and Nathalie does a good job of tying in different contexts to the readings.",
          "of all the professors for Spanish 250\ud87c\ude51\ud87c\ude60\ud87c\ude61, Nathalie is the best. take literature with her. she is challenging and expects a lot but males class enjoyable. Participation is a large portion of the grade, which, if you do readings and pay attention in class is really beneficial. Nathalie is really helpful and understanding.",

I felt this quarter my Spanish (vocab and writing) improved more than any other quarter I've been at Northwestern. He's also lovely to talk to in office hours. The quizzes are definitely tricky, not really worth a lot though. I'll miss Wheezy (his dog), well and him too",
          "It was a good class. It was fun at times. Professor would take his dog; it was great. Material is pretty interesting. Material consisted of short stories and poems. Professor understands we might not understand something so he helps us go through it during class.",

          "This class was really interesting!",
          "Prof. Coronado is enthusiastic and really wants students to participate and be interested in class. Sometimes the readings were overwhelming but I really enjoyed the class.",
          "Would HIGHLY recommend taking this course! Dr. Coronado is one of my favorite professors at NU. The paper assignments aren't difficult, and going to office hours is really helpful to think through your thesis. I liked a lot of the selected readings, especially those on magic realism. You're not expected to understand what readings mean going into class, as long as you understand the storyline. Dr. Coronado does a good job of making sure we understand what's going on. The quizzes focus on details you may not pick up on when reading a language that's not your first (even if they are more story-line type and not deeper meaning), so be sure to read a couple of times!",
          "The class was straight-forward and engaging, and the texts were interesting. Prof. Coronado is really helpful if you go in for extra help, and his expectations for essays are clear. I learned a lot and enjoyed it."

          "Way too much unhelpful busy work is assigned for this class. It takes hours to complete the weekly assignments, and then you need to dedicate even more time to teaching yourself the concepts outside of the assignment, because they are completely ineffective. There's also a huge vocab divide between students from 101 and kids who have taken 4 years of spanish in highschool. Students from 101 are expected to complete assignments and speak in class with way more vocabulary than the into class exposed them to.",
          "It was good for being a required course, but didn't affect my interest in the Spanish language at all. Most of the time the activities were annoying to complete, especially the movies we had to watch outside of class. It was very much an introductory course meant to focus solely on the language and its rules.",
          "I like how the assignments that determine your grade were spread out, no one set of quizzes\u02fexam can fail you. It was more holistic and allowed for you to shine even if you are not good at one type of assessment",
          "I felt the class environment was very helpful to learning however you always need to pay attention and be prepared (or be good at winging it). There's some busy work sometimes but if you actually do it, it will help you in the long run. The video quizzes aren't so bad but the short videos in link with the book are so give yourself time to understand those. Overall, it's not a bad class as long as you put the effort in (which I suggest doing)!",

          "This class is fine if you have to take it to fulfill a requirement. Profesora Aubeneau is nice and is clearly passionate about making sure the students are able to hold conversations in consistent, correct Spanish. However, sometimes homework assignments are excessive and her grading is erratic. If you're an introvert, this class will definitely challenge you early on.",
          "This is a traditional language class with frequent vocab and grammar quizzes and homework that takes around 30 minutes. Beyond that though I really enjoyed the discussions we had in this class and my Spanish speaking really improved because we did a lot of in class discussions.

          "This class is a review of last year, and therefore you are expected to know a lot coming in. Nelida expected too much. I walked out of class feeling stupid instead of inspired because of her comments and corrections.",
          "Typical Spanish course with lots of emphasis on speaking and listening. Most learning is done through the textbook, and class is mostly dedicated to practicing speaking and reviewing homework. Overall good experience with Aubeneau: fair grader, and does what she can to make class enjoyable given the constraints of the course.",
          "Tests were fair, homework didn't take too long for the most part",
          "The material is taught well, but there are too many extra assignments like watching Spanish movies and clips. Moves quickly enough.",
          "I liked using the different medias to learn about cultural material",
          "Requires more studying than 115 sequence.",
          "Nelida is awesome! There is a larger component of participation in 121 than in 101, but the vocab and grammar is mostly a review. The book isn't as good this year and the videos can be a bit tedious and hard to understand",
          "Aubeneau is a really great teacher and one of the nicest people, highly recommend taking this class with her.",
          "This class was such a great class. The material was interesting and I feel more confident in my Spanish skills. The professor knew what she was doing! Great teacher, and a fun class!",
          "Fine class, goes through the important topics of Spanish."

          "This class is pretty interesting and the workload is not bad. Part of the curriculum looks at the theory and make-up of different kinds of writing which is something I had never really thought about before. Baez is well-informed and cares about her students, and if you participate in class discussions you can get a lot out of them.",
          "This course is amazing! Profesora Baez is so kind and insightful. She puts a lot of effort into giving students constructive feedback on their essays which helps immensely in turning in polished work. She genuinely cares about students understanding the readings that she assigns, and her enthusiasm for the material makes class discussions so enjoyable.",
          "This class is really interesting, you get to study a variety of genres, authors, and time frames, giving you a good sampling of literature (which might also help you pick more specific class topics later on). The requirements for this are really manageable, do the readings (which aren't too time intensive), present once and write a couple essays. Ana Baez is a really great professor and she gets the class to contribute without pushing too hard, her feedback on essays, projects, and reading are also helpful.",
          "A student COULD learn a lot from this course, if they so chose. This was a very \"mature\" class in that you got out of it as much as you put into it. Honestly \u2013 if worst came to worst \u2013 you could get by skipping a reading or too, but if you read them in depth & participated in class, you could also learn so much about both literature and the language.",
          "Really great class with not too difficult of a workload. Profesora Baez is incredible, understanding, and knowledgeable.",
          "I think the student presentations were very helpful.",
          "Low-key frustrated that I bought the $60 textbook. The other book, which was $10 on Amazon, was actually just scanned to Canvas, so also not necessary. But all of the readings could have been found online, half of them were uploaded to Canvas and weren't even in the textbook anyway. I really think that all the readings should just be scanned, I only used the textbook once for a text that I couldn't find online. Aside from that, the class was great, incredibly similar to AP Spanish Lit. There were only five readings I didn't recognize having taken AP Lit. There were no exams, only three essays, two 4-pages and one 6-pages. They were all 20% of our grade, with a presentation also 20% and participation the final 20%. Most people got 10\u2f10 on the presentation, and the lowest anyone got on the papers was a 90, some with 100. Super easy A. Baez was super excited and really good at explaining the concepts to us.",
          "The curriculum was phenomenal, the first spanish class ive taken at NU that centered content from latinamerica and especially the carribean. I wish that we had discussed some of the ideas further but I understand the limitations of the quarter system",
          "Thought the readings were interesting and prof was really able to help us better understand them and stimulate interest.",
          "This is a good introduction to Latin American (and some Spanish) literary texts. Baez covers a wide range of topics which is pretty ambitious for such a short class. Overall a good class to take as an intro to literary analysis and seminal Latin American texts."
